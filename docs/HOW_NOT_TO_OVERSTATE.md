## W80 (P0-Blocker Attack — Frontier-Quality Local Runtime / Runtime Instrumentation Contract / Second-Backend Parity Matrix / Living Capability Matrix / Live Local-Model Evaluation) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W80 milestone closes the five P0 blocker meta-issues (#5,
#6, #8, #12, #17) by adding a canonical runtime instrumentation
contract V1, a second pretrained-transformer controlled runtime
V1 (HF transformers, default `distilbert/distilgpt2`), a runtime
parity matrix V1 across both backends, a living hosted-vs-local
capability matrix V1, and the R-201 live local-model benchmark
family (22 H-bars, all pass on distilgpt2 in fp32 CPU). Honest
reading:

- **W80 does NOT claim a frontier-scale model.** The default
  live model is distilgpt2 (~82M params). The load-bearing W80
  claim is that the W80 instrumentation contract works on a
  *real pretrained* transformer, not that distilgpt2 is
  competitive at scale.
- **W80 does NOT pierce third-party hosted-model substrate.**
  The W79 hosted boundary V12 frontier-blocked axes set is
  carried forward unchanged. The W80 capability matrix surfaces
  the hosted-blocked / local-universal asymmetry *honestly*; it
  does not claim hosted-side wins from local-runtime evidence.
- **W80 does NOT claim universal parity across backends.** The
  parity matrix surfaces backend asymmetry explicitly. On the
  HF runtime, attention-bias steering, attention probs read,
  per-layer logits read, hidden-state inject, prefix-state
  inject are tagged `BACKEND_SPECIFIC` to acknowledge that they
  work via forward-hook / `attention_mask` augmentation /
  `inputs_embeds` rewiring rather than via a clean universal
  API.
- **W80 does NOT claim byte-identical replay outside fp32 on
  CPU.** Quantised inference, GPU paths, and mixed-precision
  paths are explicitly outside V1 scope. fp32 CPU replay
  reaches max abs diff < 5e-3 on the final new-token row;
  typically < 1e-3 on distilgpt2.
- **R-201 does NOT claim third-party hosted wins.** It is a
  *local-runtime* benchmark; its measurements are evidence for
  the local controlled runtime, not for any hosted API.
- **R-201's token-work savings are local-runtime savings, not
  hosted-billing savings.** Substrate-routed KV-cache replay
  skips re-running old-token forwards on the local backend; it
  does not reduce hosted-API token billing.
- **The capability matrix is *living*, not authoritative.**
  Every refresh probes the local plane fresh; the matrix CID
  changes on every build (refreshed_at_ns moves). Surface
  capability declarations are the truth-source; the matrix is
  the snapshot.

## W78 (Stronger Less-Bounded Long-Horizon Reconstruction / Bounded-Window-Falsifier Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W78 milestone introduces the V23 substrate (V22 substrate +
one new long-horizon-reconstruction axis), the thirty-policy
MASC V14 across eighteen regimes, the TCC V13, the hosted
control plane V11 modules, the new **long-horizon-reconstruction-
aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V10** that adds long-
horizon-reconstruction-aware promotion + long-delay-
reconstruction-after-compound-chain-failure fallback decision,
the new **long-horizon-reconstruction-aware provider filter
V10**, the new **long-horizon-reconstruction substrate V1**
(the load-bearing W78 win — reads from persistent latent V30
carrier, not the visible window), and the new **bounded-window
baseline V1** module (the load-bearing anti-goal falsifier).
Honest reading:

* W78 is a single-step extension of W77. V23 strictly extends
  V22 (does not replace it). All seventeen W77 regimes remain
  load-bearing; W78 adds exactly one new regime
  (``long_delay_reconstruction_after_compound_chain_failure``).
* V23 wins are in-repo synthetic. The 100 % strict-beat rate of
  V23 over V22 across eighteen regimes is measured *inside* the
  deterministic MASC V14 harness. It is NOT a real-model multi-
  agent task win. ``W78-L-MASC-V14-SYNTHETIC-CAP``.
* The long-horizon-reconstruction-trajectory CID proves integrity
  only at the in-repo substrate. The hosted surface does not see
  it. ``W78-L-LONG-HORIZON-RECONSTRUCTION-IN-REPO-CAP``.
* **The bounded-window-insufficiency claim is structural, not
  scaled-to-frontier.** ``W78-T-BOUNDED-WINDOW-INSUFFICIENT``
  proves that any predictor restricted to the last k visible
  turns has zero information about events outside that window;
  the W78 long-horizon-reconstruction substrate reads from the
  persistent V30 carrier instead. The proof is by construction
  within the synthetic regime; we do NOT claim that frontier
  LLMs with long context windows are similarly bounded — they
  have soft, learned attention, not a hard fixed-k window. The
  W78 result is "fixed-k-transcript baselines are insufficient
  for long-horizon multi-agent state retention", which is the
  load-bearing anti-goal of the milestone.
* No third-party hosted model has been bridged. The wall V11
  enumerates 46 blocked axes; the W70 frontier_blocked_axes
  list is unchanged. ``W78-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``,
  ``W78-L-FRONTIER-SUBSTRATE-STILL-BLOCKED-CAP``.
* No version bump, no PyPI release. ``coordpy.__version__ ==
  "0.5.20"``, ``coordpy.SDK_VERSION == "coordpy.sdk.v3.43"``
  byte-for-byte unchanged.

## W76 (Stronger Restart-After-Compound-Chain-Repair / Compound-Chain-Then-Restart Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W76 milestone introduces the V21 substrate (23 layers + three
new V21 axes), the twenty-six-policy MASC V12 across sixteen
regimes, the TCC V11, the hosted control plane V9 modules, the
new **chain-then-restart-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator
V8** that adds chain-then-restart-aware promotion + restart-
after-compound-chain-repair fallback decision, and the new
**chain-then-restart-aware provider filter V8**. Honest reading:

* W76 is a single-step extension of W75. V21 strictly extends V20
  (does not replace it). All fifteen W75 regimes remain load-
  bearing; W76 adds exactly one new regime
  (``restart_after_compound_chain_repair_under_budget``).
* V21 wins are in-repo synthetic. The 100 % strict-beat rate of
  V21 over V20 across sixteen regimes is measured *inside* the
  deterministic MASC V12 harness. It is NOT a real-model multi-
  agent task win. ``W76-L-MASC-V12-SYNTHETIC-CAP``.
* The chain-then-restart-trajectory CID proves integrity only at
  the in-repo substrate. The hosted surface does not see it.
  ``W76-L-CHAIN-THEN-RESTART-IN-REPO-CAP``.
* The hosted plane V9 does NOT pierce the wall. ≥ 40 blocked
  axes at the hosted surface (W75's 37 + 3 new V21 axes).
  ``W76-L-HOSTED-V9-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``.
* Frontier-model substrate access remains the unsolved wall.
  W76 carries the W70 frontier_blocked_axes set forward
  unchanged. ``W76-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``.
* The handoff V8 coordinator preserves the wall as a content-
  addressed invariant. ``W76-L-HANDOFF-V8-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-
  CAP``.
* Chain-then-restart pressure is caller-declared; the substrate
  reads it as an input. ``W76-L-CHAIN-THEN-RESTART-PRESSURE-
  DECLARED-CAP``.
* All hosted V9 scores (success, quality, budget, pressures
  including chain-then-restart) are caller-declared; the router
  does NOT measure live success. ``W76-L-HOSTED-V9-DECLARED-
  CAP``.
* All ridge solves are closed-form linear; no SGD / autograd /
  GPU. 76 ridge solves total across W61..W76. ``W76-L-V21-NO-
  AUTOGRAD-CAP``.
* No version bump. No PyPI release. ``coordpy.__version__ ==
  "0.5.20"`` and ``SDK_VERSION == "coordpy.sdk.v3.43"`` byte-
  for-byte unchanged.

When describing W76 outcomes:
- Say "V21 strictly beats V20 in the synthetic MASC V12 harness
  across all sixteen regimes", NOT "V21 wins on real models".
- Say "chain-then-restart-aware handoff V8 saves ≥ 85 % visible
  tokens vs forcing every turn through hosted_only at default
  config", NOT "handoff V8 saves 85 % vs hosted in production".
- Say "boundary V9 enumerates 40 blocked axes at the hosted
  surface", NOT "hosted APIs now expose 40 fewer blocked axes".

## W75 (Stronger Compound-Chain-Repair / Replacement-Then-Delayed-Repair-Then-Rejoin Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W75 milestone introduces the V20 substrate (22 layers + three
new V20 axes), the twenty-four-policy MASC V11 across fifteen
regimes, the TCC V10, the hosted control plane V8 modules, the new
**compound-chain-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V7** that
promotes turns with compound-chain pressure above the floor to
Plane B and adds a
``compound_repair_after_replacement_then_rejoin_fallback``
decision, and the compound-chain-aware provider filter V7. The
substrate now produces multi-agent task-success wins under
**fifteen** named failure-mode regimes (W74's fourteen plus
``compound_repair_after_replacement_then_rejoin_under_budget``).
The honest scope:

1. **Twentieth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V20 substrate adds 22 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W75-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   The fifteen-regime V20-beats-V19 / TSC_V20-beats-TSC_V19 wins
   are measured *inside* the W75 in-repo MASC V11 harness, not
   against a frontier model
   (``W75-L-MASC-V11-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **The hosted control plane does not pierce the wall.** Plane A
   V8 modules (router V8, logprob V8, cache-aware planner V8, cost
   planner V8, boundary V8, handoff V7, provider filter V7)
   operate only at the HTTP text-and-logprobs-and-prefix-cache
   surface (``W75-L-HOSTED-V8-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``).
4. **Compound-chain pressure is caller-declared.** The new
   ``compound_chain_pressure`` knob on hosted V8 modules and the
   substrate V20 forward is a *caller-declared* signal, not a
   live measurement (``W75-L-HOSTED-V8-COMPOUND-CHAIN-DECLARED-
   CAP``, ``W75-L-COMPOUND-CHAIN-PRESSURE-DECLARED-CAP``).
5. **The compound-chain-repair-trajectory CID is in-repo only.**
   It is a deterministic SHA-256 hash over V19 compound-repair-
   trajectory CID + eleven recorded primitive event chains + V20
   compound-chain windows. It does NOT prove compound-chain
   integrity at any third-party hosted surface
   (``W75-L-COMPOUND-CHAIN-REPAIR-IN-REPO-CAP``).
6. **The handoff V7 coordinator preserves the wall.** When V7
   promotes a turn to Plane B it does so under a content-addressed
   invariant; it does NOT cross the substrate boundary
   (``W75-L-HANDOFF-V7-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``).
7. **Frontier-model substrate access remains unsolved.** W75
   carries the W70 ``frontier_blocked_axes`` set forward unchanged
   (``W75-L-FRONTIER-SUBSTRATE-STILL-BLOCKED-CAP``).
8. **No version bump.** ``coordpy.__version__`` remains
   ``"0.5.20"`` and ``SDK_VERSION`` remains ``"coordpy.sdk.v3.43"``;
   nothing in W75 ships to PyPI.

## W74 (Stronger Compound-Repair / Replacement-After-Delayed-Repair Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W74 milestone introduces the V19 substrate (21 layers + three
new V19 axes), the twenty-two-policy MASC V10 across fourteen
regimes, the TCC V9, the hosted control plane V7 modules, the new
**compound-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V6** that
promotes turns with compound pressure above the floor to Plane B
and adds a
``compound_repair_after_delayed_repair_then_replacement_fallback``
decision, and the compound-aware provider filter V6. The substrate
now produces multi-agent task-success wins under **fourteen**
named failure-mode regimes (W73's thirteen plus
``replacement_after_delayed_repair_under_budget``). The honest
scope:

1. **Nineteenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V19 substrate adds 21 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W74-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V10 runs twenty-two policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V19 policy beats V18 because the V19
   mechanisms (compound-repair-trajectory CID + compound-repair-
   rate per-layer + compound-pressure gate) are engineered to
   materially help in the fourteen regimes, particularly the new
   compound regime. **This is not a real hosted multi-agent win**
   (``W74-L-MASC-V10-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Three new
   ridge solves on top of W73's 67 (70 total across W61..W74); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W74-L-V19-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator V6 preserves the wall.** The
   compound-aware handoff V6 does NOT cross the substrate boundary.
   It records *which plane handled each turn* under a compound-
   aware score and exposes a compound falsifier
   (``W74-L-HANDOFF-V6-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``). When V6 returns
   ``compound_repair_after_delayed_repair_then_replacement_fallback``,
   the envelope still records Plane A handled the turn (with the
   substrate signalling that the team needs Plane B); the boundary
   stays content-addressed.
5. **Hosted V7 is caller-declared.** Budgets, restart pressure,
   rejoin pressure, replacement pressure, compound pressure, and
   provider quality scores are caller-declared; V7 does not measure
   live success (``W74-L-HOSTED-V7-DECLARED-CAP``,
   ``W74-L-HOSTED-V7-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``).
6. **Frontier substrate access is still blocked.** W74 carries the
   W70 ``frontier_blocked_axes`` set forward unchanged at boundary
   V7. The transformer-internal bridge to a frontier-quality
   runtime remains conjectural (``W74-C-FRONTIER-HOSTED-BRIDGE-
   NEEDED``).

## W73 (Stronger Contradiction-Rejoin / Replacement / Delayed-Repair Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W73 milestone introduces the V18 substrate (20 layers + three
new V18 axes), the twenty-policy MASC V9 across thirteen regimes,
the TCC V8, the hosted control plane V6 modules, the new
**replacement-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V5** that
promotes turns with replacement pressure above the floor to Plane
B and adds a ``replacement_after_contradiction_then_rejoin_fallback``
decision, and the replacement-aware provider filter V5. The
substrate now produces multi-agent task-success wins under
**thirteen** named failure-mode regimes (W72's twelve plus
``replacement_after_contradiction_then_rejoin``). The honest scope:

1. **Eighteenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V18 substrate adds 20 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W73-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V9 runs twenty policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V18 policy beats V17 because the V18
   mechanisms (replacement-repair-trajectory CID + replacement-
   after-CTR per-layer + replacement-pressure gate) are
   engineered to materially help in the thirteen regimes,
   particularly the new compound regime. **This is not a real
   hosted multi-agent win** (``W73-L-MASC-V9-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Three new
   ridge solves on top of W72's 64 (67 total across W61..W73); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W73-L-V18-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator V5 preserves the wall.** The
   replacement-aware handoff V5 does NOT cross the substrate
   boundary. It records *which plane handled each turn* under a
   replacement-aware score and exposes a replacement falsifier
   (``W73-L-HANDOFF-V5-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``). When V5 returns
   ``replacement_after_contradiction_then_rejoin_fallback``, the
   envelope still records Plane A handled the turn (with the
   substrate signalling that the team needs Plane B); the
   boundary stays content-addressed.
5. **Hosted V6 is caller-declared.** Budgets, restart pressure,
   rejoin pressure, replacement pressure, and provider quality
   scores are caller-declared; V6 does not measure live success
   (``W73-L-HOSTED-V6-DECLARED-CAP``,
   ``W73-L-HOSTED-V6-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``).
6. **Frontier substrate access is still blocked.** W73 carries the
   W70 ``frontier_blocked_axes`` set forward unchanged at boundary
   V6. The transformer-internal bridge to a frontier-quality
   runtime remains conjectural (``W73-C-FRONTIER-HOSTED-BRIDGE-
   NEEDED``).

## W72 (Stronger Delayed-Rejoin-After-Restart / Restart-Repair-Trajectory Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W72 milestone introduces the V17 substrate (19 layers + three
new V17 axes), the eighteen-policy MASC V8 across twelve regimes,
the TCC V7, the hosted control plane V5 modules, the new
**rejoin-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V4** that promotes
turns with rejoin pressure above the floor to Plane B and adds a
``delayed_rejoin_after_restart_fallback`` decision, and the
rejoin-aware provider filter V4. The substrate now produces
multi-agent task-success wins under **twelve** named failure-mode
regimes (W71's eleven plus
``delayed_rejoin_after_restart_under_budget``). The honest scope:

1. **Seventeenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V17 substrate adds 19 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W72-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V8 runs eighteen policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V17 policy beats V16 because the V17
   mechanisms (restart-repair-trajectory CID + delayed-rejoin-
   after-restart per-layer + rejoin-pressure gate) are engineered
   to materially help in the twelve regimes, particularly the new
   compound regime. **This is not a real hosted multi-agent win**
   (``W72-L-MASC-V8-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Three new
   ridge solves on top of W71's 61 (64 total across W61..W72); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W72-L-V17-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator V4 preserves the wall.** The rejoin-
   aware handoff V4 does NOT cross the substrate boundary. It
   records *which plane handled each turn* under a rejoin-aware
   score and exposes a delayed-rejoin falsifier
   (``W72-L-HANDOFF-V4-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``). When V4 returns
   ``delayed_rejoin_after_restart_fallback``, the envelope still
   records Plane A handled the turn (with the substrate signalling
   that the team needs Plane B); the boundary stays content-
   addressed.
5. **Hosted V5 is caller-declared.** Budgets, restart pressure,
   rejoin pressure, and provider quality scores are caller-
   declared; V5 does not measure live success
   (``W72-L-HOSTED-V5-DECLARED-CAP``,
   ``W72-L-HOSTED-V5-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``).
6. **Frontier substrate access is still blocked.** W72 carries the
   W70 ``frontier_blocked_axes`` set forward unchanged at boundary
   V5. The transformer-internal bridge to a frontier-quality
   runtime remains conjectural (``W72-C-FRONTIER-HOSTED-BRIDGE-
   NEEDED``).

## W71 (Stronger Delayed-Repair-After-Restart / Repair-Trajectory-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W71 milestone introduces the V16 substrate (18 layers + three
new V16 axes), the sixteen-policy MASC V7 across eleven regimes,
the TCC V6, the hosted control plane V4 modules, the new
**restart-aware hosted-real handoff coordinator V3** that promotes
turns with restart pressure above the floor to Plane B and adds a
``delayed_repair_fallback`` decision, and the restart-aware provider
filter V3. The substrate now produces multi-agent task-success wins
under **eleven** named failure-mode regimes (W70's ten plus
``delayed_repair_after_restart``). The honest scope:

1. **Sixteenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V16 substrate adds 18 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W71-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V7 runs sixteen policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V16 policy beats V15 because the V16
   mechanisms (delayed-repair-trajectory CID + restart-dominance-
   per-layer + delayed-repair gate) are engineered to materially
   help in the eleven regimes, particularly the new compound
   regime. **This is not a real hosted multi-agent win**
   (``W71-L-MASC-V7-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Three new
   ridge solves on top of W70's 58 (61 total across W61..W71); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W71-L-V16-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator V3 preserves the wall.** The restart-
   aware handoff V3 does NOT cross the substrate boundary. It
   records *which plane handled each turn* under a restart-aware
   score and exposes a delayed-repair falsifier
   (``W71-L-HANDOFF-V3-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``). When V3 returns
   ``delayed_repair_fallback``, the envelope still records Plane A
   handled the turn (with the substrate signalling that the team
   needs Plane B); the boundary stays content-addressed.
5. **Hosted V4 is caller-declared.** Budgets, restart pressure, and
   provider quality scores are caller-declared; V4 does not measure
   live success (``W71-L-HOSTED-V4-DECLARED-CAP``,
   ``W71-L-HOSTED-V4-NO-SUBSTRATE-CAP``).
6. **Frontier substrate access is still blocked.** W71 carries the
   W70 ``frontier_blocked_axes`` set forward unchanged at boundary
   V4. The transformer-internal bridge to a frontier-quality
   runtime remains conjectural (``W71-C-FRONTIER-HOSTED-BRIDGE-
   NEEDED``).

## W70 (Stronger Repair-Dominance / Budget-Primary Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate Programme) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W70 milestone introduces the V15 substrate (17 layers + three
new V15 axes), the fourteen-policy MASC V6 across ten regimes, the
TCC V5, the hosted control plane V3 modules, and the new **budget-
primary hosted-real handoff coordinator V2** that scores each turn
by ``team_success_per_visible_token`` and exposes a repair-dominance
falsifier. The substrate now produces multi-agent task-success wins
under **ten** named failure-mode regimes (W69's nine plus
contradiction_then_rejoin_under_budget). The honest scope:

1. **Fifteenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V15 substrate adds 17 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W70-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V6 runs fourteen policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V15 policy beats V14 because the V15
   mechanisms (repair-trajectory CID + dominant-repair-per-layer +
   budget-primary gate) are engineered to materially help in the
   ten regimes, particularly the new compound regime. **This is
   not a real hosted multi-agent win**
   (``W70-L-MASC-V6-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Five new
   ridge solves on top of W69's 53 (58 total across W61..W70); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W70-L-V15-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator V2 preserves the wall.** The budget-
   primary handoff V2 does NOT cross the substrate boundary. It
   records *which plane handled each turn* under a budget-primary
   score and exposes a repair-dominance falsifier
   (``W70-L-HANDOFF-V2-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``). When V2 returns
   ``hosted_with_real_substrate_audit`` the substrate audit happens
   on Plane B (in-repo V15); the hosted reply remains text-only.
   When V2 returns ``budget_primary_fallback`` the request
   gracefully falls back without claiming substrate access.
5. **TCC V5 operates on synthetic MASC V6 outcomes.** The repair-
   dominance arbiter, budget-primary arbiter, and contradiction-
   then-rejoin arbiter are deterministic on the in-repo decisions
   (``W70-L-TEAM-CONSENSUS-V5-IN-REPO-CAP``).
6. **The repair-trajectory CID is in-repo.** It is computed from
   byte-stable repair-primitive witness contents (numpy arrays +
   sorted role dicts + repair events) only. It does NOT prove
   repair integrity at the hosted surface
   (``W70-L-REPAIR-TRAJECTORY-IN-REPO-CAP``).
7. **The budget-primary gate is calibrated, not learned.** It
   combines caller-declared visible-token budget with substrate-
   measured features via a fixed sigmoid; budgets are caller-
   supplied (``W70-L-BUDGET-PRIMARY-DECLARED-CAP``).
8. **LHR V22 only fits the final ridge head.** The first eleven
   preceding layers are frozen random projections
   (``W70-L-V22-LHR-SCORER-FIT-CAP``).
9. **Persistent V22 wrapper does NOT train the V13 outer GRU**
   (``W70-L-V22-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP``).
10. **The released SDK is unchanged.** ``coordpy.__version__ ==
    "0.5.20"``. No PyPI release. The smoke driver passes byte-for-
    byte. W70 reaches only via explicit imports
    (``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v15`` etc.).
11. **The new compound regime win is measured inside the V15
    substrate only.** The V15 policy wins in
    contradiction_then_rejoin_under_budget because the V15 repair-
    trajectory CID + budget-primary gate let the substrate-routed
    policy run a coordinated repair arc that V14 cannot follow.
    Synthetic.
12. **Hosted V3 success / quality / budget scores are caller-
    declared.** The router V3 budget-efficiency weighting uses
    caller-supplied per-provider scores and per-request budgets;
    the router does not measure live success
    (``W70-L-HOSTED-V3-DECLARED-CAP``).
13. **The frontier wall is unmoved.** W70 carries the W69
    frontier_blocked_axes set forward unchanged as an honest no-
    progress marker
    (``W70-L-FRONTIER-SUBSTRATE-STILL-BLOCKED-CAP``).

## W69 (Stronger Solving-Context Two-Plane Multi-Agent Substrate) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W69 milestone introduces the V14 substrate (16 layers + four
new V14 axes), the twelve-policy MASC V5 across nine regimes, the
TCC V4, the hosted control plane V2 modules, and the new
**hosted-real handoff coordinator** that operationalises the
Plane A↔B split with content-addressed handoff envelopes. The
substrate now produces multi-agent task-success wins under
**nine** named failure-mode regimes (W68's seven plus
multi_branch_rejoin_after_divergent_work and
silent_corruption_plus_member_replacement). The honest scope:

1. **Fourteenth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V14 substrate adds 16 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (``W69-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V5 runs twelve policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V14 policy beats V13 because the V14
   mechanisms (multi-branch-rejoin witness + silent-corruption
   primitive + substrate self-checksum) are engineered to
   materially help in the new regimes. **This is not a real
   hosted multi-agent win** (``W69-L-MULTI-AGENT-COORDINATOR-V5-
   SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Six new
   ridge solves on top of W68's 47 (53 total across W61..W69); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (``W69-L-V14-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``).
4. **The handoff coordinator preserves the wall.** The hosted ↔
   real-substrate handoff coordinator does NOT cross the substrate
   boundary. It records *which plane handled each turn* and
   exposes a falsifier (``W69-L-HANDOFF-NOT-CROSSING-WALL-CAP``).
   When the coordinator returns ``hosted_with_real_substrate_audit``
   the substrate audit happens on Plane B (in-repo V14); the
   hosted reply remains text-only.
5. **TCC V4 operates on synthetic MASC V5 outcomes.** The multi-
   branch-rejoin arbiter and silent-corruption-plus-replacement
   arbiter are deterministic on the in-repo decisions
   (``W69-L-TEAM-CONSENSUS-V4-IN-REPO-CAP``).
6. **Multi-hop V19 backends are named, not executed.** 48
   backends and 2256 directed edges
   (``W69-L-MULTI-HOP-V19-SYNTHETIC-BACKENDS-CAP``).
7. **CRC V17 131072-bucket fingerprint is wrap-around XOR.** The
   37-bit adversarial burst is a stress test, not a real
   adversarial attack (``W69-L-CRC-V17-FINGERPRINT-SYNTHETIC-CAP``).
8. **ECC V21 rate ceiling is structural.** log2(2^35) = 35 raw
   data bits per segment-tuple (``W69-L-ECC-V21-RATE-FLOOR-CAP``);
   the 65536-bit/token target trivially exceeds this and the
   falsifier reproduces it.
9. **LHR V21 only fits the final ridge head.** The first ten
   preceding layers are frozen random projections
   (``W69-L-V21-LHR-SCORER-FIT-CAP``).
10. **Persistent V21 wrapper does NOT train the V13 outer GRU**
    (``W69-L-V21-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP``).
11. **Prefix V13 K=256 extension is structural.** It uses V12's
    K=192 prediction with last-value extrapolation; no new ridge
    fit (``W69-L-V13-PREFIX-K256-STRUCTURAL-CAP``).
12. **The released SDK is unchanged.** ``coordpy.__version__ ==
    "0.5.20"``. No PyPI release. The smoke driver passes byte-for-
    byte. W69 reaches only via explicit imports
    (``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v14`` etc.).
13. **The new regime wins are measured inside the V14 substrate
    only.** The V14 policy wins in multi-branch-rejoin because the
    V14 multi-branch-rejoin witness lets even
    ``substrate_routed_v14`` alone reason about all three branches
    in parallel; the V14 policy wins in silent-corruption-plus-
    member-replacement because the V14 substrate self-checksum
    CID + silent-corruption witness + member-replacement flag give
    the substrate the structural signal to repair from surviving
    agents. Both are synthetic.
14. **Hosted V2 success scores are caller-declared.** The router
    V2 score-weighting uses caller-supplied per-provider success
    scores; the router does not measure live success
    (``W69-L-HOSTED-V2-SUCCESS-DECLARED-CAP``).
15. **The substrate self-checksum is in-repo.** The 1-byte detect
    rate is structurally 1 − 1/2^256 by SHA-256; that does NOT
    prove substrate integrity at the hosted surface
    (``W69-L-SELF-CHECKSUM-IN-REPO-CAP``).
16. **The frontier wall is unmoved.** W69 codifies the
    frontier_blocked_axes set (third-party hosted hidden_state /
    KV / attention reads) as an honest no-progress marker
    (``W69-L-FRONTIER-SUBSTRATE-STILL-BLOCKED-CAP``).

## W67 (Stronger Branch-Merge / Role-Dropout Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

The W67 milestone introduces the V12 substrate (14 layers + four
new V12 axes), the eight-policy MASC V3 across five regimes, and
the TCC V2. The substrate now produces multi-agent task-success
wins under **five** named failure-mode regimes (the three from W66
plus role-dropout and branch-merge-reconciliation). The honest
scope:

1. **Twelfth substrate-attack milestone — still in-repo NumPy.**
   The V12 substrate adds 14 layers, GQA 8q/4kv, RMSNorm, SwiGLU,
   d_model=64, vocab=259 — *still NOT a frontier model*. Hosted
   backends remain text-only at the HTTP surface
   (`W67-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`).
2. **Multi-agent task wins are synthetic-harness-load-bearing.**
   MASC V3 runs eight policies on a synthetic deterministic
   coordination task; the V12 policy beats V11 because the V12
   mechanisms (snapshot-fork + branch-merge primitive +
   role-dropout-recovery flag) are engineered to materially help
   in the new regimes. **This is not a real hosted multi-agent
   win** (`W67-L-MULTI-AGENT-COORDINATOR-V3-SYNTHETIC-CAP`).
3. **All "training" remains closed-form linear ridge.** Six new
   ridge solves on top of W66's 35 (41 total across W61..W67); no
   SGD, no autograd, no GPU (`W67-L-V12-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP`).
4. **Branch-merge primitive is in-repo.** The
   `substrate_snapshot_fork_v12` / `substrate_branch_merge_v12`
   pair operates on the V12 cache only
   (`W67-L-SUBSTRATE-BRANCH-MERGE-IN-REPO-CAP`).
5. **TCC V2 operates on synthetic MASC V3 outcomes.** The branch-
   merge arbiter / role-dropout-repair head are deterministic on
   the in-repo decisions
   (`W67-L-TEAM-CONSENSUS-V2-IN-REPO-CAP`).
6. **Multi-hop V17 backends are named, not executed.** 40
   backends and 1560 directed edges
   (`W67-L-MULTI-HOP-V17-SYNTHETIC-BACKENDS-CAP`).
7. **CRC V15 32768-bucket fingerprint is wrap-around XOR.** The
   35-bit adversarial burst is a stress test, not a real
   adversarial attack (`W67-L-CRC-V15-FINGERPRINT-SYNTHETIC-CAP`).
8. **ECC V19 rate ceiling is structural.** log2(2^31) = 31 raw
   data bits per segment-tuple
   (`W67-L-ECC-V19-RATE-FLOOR-CAP`); the 65536-bit/token target
   trivially exceeds this and the falsifier reproduces it.
9. **LHR V19 only fits the final ridge head.** The eight
   preceding layers are frozen random projections
   (`W67-L-V19-LHR-SCORER-FIT-CAP`).
10. **Persistent V19 wrapper does NOT train the V13 outer GRU**
    (`W67-L-V19-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP`).
11. **Prefix V11 K=128 extension is structural.** It uses V10's
    prediction with last-value extrapolation; no new ridge fit
    (`W67-L-V11-PREFIX-K128-STRUCTURAL-CAP`).
12. **The released SDK is unchanged.** `coordpy.__version__ ==
    "0.5.20"`. No PyPI release. The smoke driver passes byte-for-
    byte. W67 reaches only via explicit imports
    (`coordpy.tiny_substrate_v12` etc.).
13. **The new regime wins are measured inside the V12 substrate
    only.** The V12 policy wins in role-dropout because the V12
    role-dropout-recovery flag lets even `substrate_routed_v12`
    alone reason about absent roles; the V12 policy wins in
    branch-merge-reconciliation because the V12 snapshot-fork
    lets the substrate carry two branches in parallel and the
    branch-merge primitive reconciles them. Both are synthetic.

## W65 (Team-Substrate-Coordination Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W65 extends W64 with twenty mechanism advances on top of W64's
nineteen (M1..M19 substrate + capsule-OS + M20 the load-bearing
**Multi-Agent Substrate Coordinator**). Honest scope:

* *"W65 proves real multi-agent task-success wins on hosted
  models"* — **forbidden**. `W65-L-MULTI-AGENT-COORDINATOR-
  SYNTHETIC-CAP` is load-bearing: the V10 head-to-head win is
  measured on a *synthetic deterministic harness*, not on a real
  model-backed multi-agent backend. The deltas (V10 success rate;
  V10-strictly-beats-each-baseline rate; visible-token savings) are
  reproducible *inside* the W65 harness and are exactly what the
  W65 mechanisms (per-role KV bank, multi-agent abstain head,
  substrate checkpoint) reduce drift on by construction.

* *"W65 trained the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  `W65-L-V10-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP` is load-bearing: every W65 fit is a
  **single-step closed-form linear ridge solve** over a small
  subspace. Cache V8 five-objective; cache V8 per-role eviction;
  replay V6 per-role per-regime (8 regimes); replay V6 multi-agent
  abstain head; HSB V9 six-target inner V6; KV V10 six-target
  inner V6. Plus W61+W62+W63+W64's 23 ridge solves carry forward.
  Total **twenty-nine closed-form linear ridge solves**.
  No SGD, no autograd, no GPU.

* *"W65 coupled CoordPy to third-party transformer internals"* —
  **forbidden**. `W65-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`
  carries forward: hosted backends (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
  remain text-only at the HTTP surface.

* *"W65's multi-agent abstain head proves abstain semantics
  generalise"* — **forbidden**. The 4×10 ridge head is fit on
  *synthetic supervision* where the abstain label is constructed
  from the first feature. The head is a *fitted version of a
  deterministic decision rule* on a bounded feature space.

* *"W65's KV V10 team-task target is in-the-wild"* — **forbidden**.
  `W65-L-TEAM-TASK-TARGET-CONSTRUCTED-CAP`: the sixth (team-task-
  routing) target is *constructed* such that the KV bridge alone
  cannot reach it without help from the multi-agent coordinator.
  It is a synthetic demonstration, not an in-the-wild measurement.

* *"W65's substrate checkpoint primitive operates on real hosted
  cache bytes"* — **forbidden**. `W65-L-SUBSTRATE-CHECKPOINT-IN-
  REPO-CAP`: the primitive operates on the in-repo V10 cache only.
  The reuse-vs-recompute flop saving is a *bookkeeping ratio*
  inside the W65 substrate, not a measurement on real models.

* *"W65's 35-backend multi-hop translator was executed across 35
  hosts"* — **forbidden**. `W65-L-MULTI-HOP-V15-SYNTHETIC-
  BACKENDS-CAP`: the backends are NAMED, not EXECUTED. V15 is a
  graph + trust arbiter, not a multi-machine harness.

* *"W65's V11 consensus stages prove team-substrate coordination
  generalises"* — **forbidden**. `W65-L-CONSENSUS-V11-SYNTHETIC-
  CAP`: the team-substrate-coordination and multi-agent abstain
  stages rely on caller-provided scores.

* *"W65's prefix V9 K=64 drift curve was fit at K=64"* —
  **forbidden**. `W65-L-V9-PREFIX-K64-STRUCTURAL-CAP`: the K=64
  extension reuses the V8 K=32 fit and zero/last-value
  extrapolates to K=64. No new ridge solve.

* *"W65 ships a frontier-scale substrate"* — **forbidden**.
  `W65-L-NUMPY-CPU-V10-SUBSTRATE-CAP`: 12 layers / d_model=64 /
  byte-vocab / max_len=128 / untrained NumPy on CPU. NOT a
  frontier model.

* *"W65's ECC V17 produces 16384 bits per visible token"* —
  **forbidden**. `W65-L-ECC-V17-RATE-FLOOR-CAP`: structural rate
  ceiling log2(2^27) = 27 raw data bits per segment-tuple. The
  16384-bit target reproduces the ceiling as a falsifier.

## W63 (Stronger Replay-Dominance Hidden-Wins 4096-Turn Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W63 extends W62 with a richer in-repo V8 runtime
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v8``: 10 layers, GQA, five new internal
axes — per-(layer, head, slot) hidden-vs-KV contention tensor,
per-layer hidden-state confidence probe, per-(layer, head, slot)
replay-determinism channel, per-(layer, head) prefix-reuse trust
ledger, per-(L, H, L, H) cross-layer-head coupling matrix),
nineteen W63 mechanism advances (V8 KV bridge, V7 HSB, V7 prefix,
V7 attention, V6 cache controller, V4 replay controller, V8
hybrid, V8 adapter, V15 persistent, V13 multi-hop, V11 capsule,
V9 consensus, V11 corruption, V15 LHR, V15 ECC, V12 TVS, V11
uncertainty, V9 disagreement), and three benchmark families
(R-134..R-136 with 49 H-bars).

* *"W63 trained the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W63-L-V8-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP`` is load-bearing: every W63 fit is
  a **single-step closed-form linear ridge solve** over a small
  subspace. Cache controller V6: three-objective stacked head
  (n_features × 3 matrix), retrieval-repair head (5-dim vector),
  composite_v6 mixture (7-vector). Replay controller V4: per-
  regime 8×4 head × 6 regimes + 7-dim regime gate + three-way
  bridge 7×3 classifier. Plus W61+W62's twelve ridge solves
  carry forward. Total **seventeen closed-form linear ridge
  solves**. No SGD, no autograd, no GPU.

* *"W63 coupled CoordPy to third-party transformer internals"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W63-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``
  is load-bearing: hosted backends (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
  remain text-only at the HTTP surface. W63 makes the **in-repo
  V8 NumPy substrate** more load-bearing, not the third-party
  hosted-model substrate.

* *"W63's three-way bridge classifier proves which bridge wins"* —
  **forbidden**. The 7×3 ridge classifier achieves ≥ 0.8 training
  accuracy on **synthetic supervision** where the labels are
  constructed from the regime feature. It is a *fitted version of
  a deterministic decision rule* on a bounded feature space; it
  does NOT itself prove hidden-state injection beats KV injection
  or prefix-state injection on real models or real workloads.

* *"W63's hidden-wins falsifier shows hidden bridges win"* —
  **forbidden**. The falsifier checks that inverting the residual
  roles *flips* the decision, returning 0 exactly when this
  invariant holds. It is a structural invariant check, not a
  measurement that hidden bridges beat KV bridges in the wild.

* *"W63's trained retrieval-repair head undoes corruption"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W63-L-CONSENSUS-V9-HIDDEN-WINS-STAGE-SYNTHETIC-
  CAP`` documents: the V9 hidden_wins_arbiter stage and the V6
  cache controller retrieval-repair head output **additive
  corrections**; they do NOT un-corrupt the raw cached state.

* *"W63's drift-curve predictor predicts real token-content
  drift"* — **forbidden**. ``W63-L-V7-PREFIX-TOKEN-FINGERPRINT-CAP``:
  the predictor's token fingerprint is a fixed SHA256 projection;
  it captures *some* token-content sensitivity, but it is not a
  learned representation of all token-content dependencies.

* *"W63's per-regime replay heads are deeply trained"* —
  **forbidden**. Each per-regime head is a single 8×4 closed-form
  ridge solve over ≤ 2 candidates per regime in the default
  config. The regime gate is a nearest-centroid classifier over
  7-dim regime features.

* *"W63's three-stage attention clamp uses information theory"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W63-L-V7-ATTN-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``: the V7
  three-stage clamp is a clip-and-rescale loop over a shrunken
  effective KL budget, with the JS upper bound estimated as
  L1^2/2. Not a calibrated information-theoretic divergence
  budget on the underlying model attention.

* *"W63's hidden-wins target in the KV bridge is in-the-wild"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W63-L-KV-BRIDGE-V8-HIDDEN-WINS-TARGET-
  CONSTRUCTED-CAP``: the fourth (hidden-wins) target in the four-
  target stack is *constructed* such that the KV bridge cannot
  reach it without help from the HSB. It is a synthetic
  demonstration of the regime, not an in-the-wild measurement.

## W62 (Trainable Replay-Dominance Hidden-vs-KV Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W62 extends W61 with a richer in-repo V7 runtime
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v7``: 9 layers, GQA, four new internal
axes — per-(layer, head, slot) cache-write ledger, per-layer
logit-lens probe, per-(layer, head, position) attention-receive
delta, per-(layer, head) replay-trust ledger), nineteen W62
mechanism advances (V7 KV bridge, V6 HSB, V6 prefix, V6
attention, V5 cache controller, V3 replay controller, V7 hybrid,
V7 adapter, V14 persistent, V12 multi-hop, V10 capsule, V8
consensus, V10 corruption, V14 LHR, V14 ECC, V11 TVS, V10
uncertainty, V8 disagreement), and three benchmark families
(R-131..R-133 with 45 H-bars).

* *"W62 trained the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W62-L-V7-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP`` is load-bearing: every W62 fit is
  a **single-step closed-form linear ridge solve** over a small
  subspace. Cache controller V5: two-objective stacked head
  (n_features × 2 matrix), trained-repair head (4-dim vector),
  composite_v5 mixture (6-vector). Replay controller V3: per-
  regime 6×4 head × 4 regimes + nearest-centroid regime gate +
  hidden-vs-KV 5×3 classifier. Plus W61's seven ridge solves
  carries forward. Total **twelve closed-form linear ridge
  solves**. No SGD, no autograd, no GPU.

* *"W62 coupled CoordPy to third-party transformer internals"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W62-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``
  is load-bearing: hosted backends (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
  remain text-only at the HTTP surface. W62 makes the **in-repo
  V7 NumPy substrate** more load-bearing, not the third-party
  hosted-model substrate.

* *"W62's logit-lens probe is the standard research logit lens"* —
  **forbidden**. The V7 logit-lens probe is a *deterministic
  linear projection* of each layer's last-position hidden state
  through a fixed random projection matrix. It is a diagnostic,
  not a calibrated intermediate-residual-stream interpretation
  through the unembedding.

* *"W62's hidden-vs-KV classifier proves which arm wins"* —
  **forbidden**. The 5×3 ridge classifier achieves ≥ 0.8
  training accuracy on **synthetic supervision** where the
  labels are constructed from the regime feature. It is a
  *fitted version of a deterministic decision rule* on a
  bounded feature space; it does NOT itself prove hidden-state
  injection beats KV injection on real models or real workloads.

* *"W62's trained corruption-repair head undoes corruption"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W62-L-CONSENSUS-V8-REPAIR-STAGE-SYNTHETIC-CAP``
  documents: the repair head outputs an **additive correction**
  to the eviction score; it does NOT un-corrupt the raw cached
  state. The corrupted bytes remain corrupted; the controller
  just decides differently about them.

* *"W62's drift-curve predictor predicts real drift"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W62-L-V6-PREFIX-DRIFT-CURVE-LINEAR-CAP``:
  the predictor is a linear ridge on a 3-d
  ``[reuse_len, recompute_len, drop_len]`` feature stacked
  across K target steps. It does NOT model token-content-
  conditional drift; it predicts only the configuration-level
  drift envelope.

* *"W62's per-regime replay heads are deeply trained"* —
  **forbidden**. Each per-regime head is a single 6×4 closed-
  form ridge solve over ≤ 2 candidates per regime in the
  default config. The regime gate is a nearest-centroid
  classifier over 5-dim regime features.

* *"W62's two-stage attention clamp uses information theory"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W62-L-V6-ATTN-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP``: the V6
  two-stage clamp is a coarse-then-fine clip-and-rescale loop
  over a shrunken effective KL budget. Not a calibrated
  information-theoretic bound.

* *"W62's seven-way bidirectional loop is autonomous"* —
  **forbidden**. The seven-way loop fires only when all seven
  axes (V6 hybrid six-way, V5 cache controller fitted heads,
  V3 replay controller per-regime decisions, hidden-vs-KV
  classifier fit, V7 cache-write ledger active, V6 attention
  two-stage clamp active, V6 prefix drift-curve predictor
  trained) ALL contribute on the same step. This is a
  *measurable* diagnostic, not a self-driving system.

* *"W62's persistent V14 retains 2048 turns end-to-end"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W62-L-V14-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP``: the V14
  outer wrapper only adds one EMA carrier (replay-dominance)
  on top of V13's nine carriers; V13's outer GRU stack is
  unchanged and untrained.

* *"W62's ECC V14 hits 4096 bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W62-L-ECC-V14-RATE-FLOOR-CAP``: the structural rate ceiling
  is log2(2^23) = 23 raw data bits per segment-tuple. The
  4096-bit target reproduces this cap as the H170c falsifier;
  the actual emit is 25.333 bits/token.

* *"W62 obsoletes W61"* — **forbidden**. W62 strictly extends
  W61 byte-for-byte. The W61 envelope CID is preserved as the
  ``w61_outer_cid`` field in the W62 envelope; the W61 verifier
  still enumerates 61 disjoint failure modes; W61 modules
  remain reachable and tested. W62 adds layers on top, not
  replaces.

* *"W62's multi-hop V12 executes 20 backends"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W62-L-MULTI-HOP-V12-SYNTHETIC-BACKENDS-CAP``: the 20
  backends are NAMED, not EXECUTED. V12 is a graph + trust
  arbiter, not a real multi-machine harness.

* *"W62's CRC V10 is cryptographically secure"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W62-L-CRC-V10-FINGERPRINT-SYNTHETIC-CAP``: the 1024-bucket
  fingerprint is wrap-around XOR; the 17-bit adversarial burst
  is a stress test, not a real adversarial cipher attack.

## W59 (Trainable Substrate-Conditioned Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W59 extends W58 with a richer in-repo runtime
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v4``: 6 layers / 8 query heads /
4 KV heads with GQA / d_model=64 / RMSNorm + SwiGLU /
cumulative-EMA KV importance / partial-prefix split-and-replay
/ per-(layer, head) hidden-state tap / 128-bucket fingerprint /
logit-Jacobian probe), five W59 substrate-facing bridges (KV V4
with **closed-form ridge fit of a 1-D correction α**, HSB V3
with **target-logit-shift ridge fit**, prefix-state V3 with
**partial-prefix reuse + K-seed drift spectrum**, attention V3
with **per-(layer, head) KL-budget clip fit**, cache controller
V2 with two new closed-form ridge policies — ``learned_hidden``
and ``learned_retrieval`` — the second of which fits a real
``d × d`` bilinear retrieval matrix), a **four-way deep hybrid
V4** (V6 ↔ substrate V4 ↔ cache-controller V2 ↔ retrieval
head), and 12 V-bumps for the rest of the W58 stack.

* *"W59 trained the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W59-L-V4-NO-AUTOGRAD-CAP`` is load-bearing: every fit is a
  **single-step closed-form linear ridge solve** over a small
  subspace — 1-D α for the KV-V4 correction along a fixed
  random direction; 1-D α for the HSB-V3 target-fit; a
  ``d``-dim linear head for ``learned_hidden`` cache controller
  V2; a ``d²``-dim flattened bilinear M-matrix for
  ``learned_retrieval`` cache controller V2; a ``d``-dim head
  for the LHR-V11 retention scorer. No SGD, no autograd, no
  PyTorch/JAX, no GPU.

* *"The W59 cache controller V2 retrieval policy beats every
  other policy at retention=0.5"* — **forbidden**. R-122 H111
  is honest: at retention=0.5 on a tiny untrained substrate,
  argmax preservation is not guaranteed by any policy; the bar
  is that the learned-retrieval controller *runs* and produces
  a finite drift signal. The closed-form ridge fit is what is
  load-bearing; whether the resulting controller beats LRU /
  importance on a given task is empirical.

* *"W59 breached transformer-internal coupling on Ollama /
  OpenAI / hosted models"* — **forbidden**. The substrate is
  still a tiny in-repo NumPy runtime.
  ``W59-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`` carries
  forward unchanged. ``W59-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` is a
  restatement of the open question on frontier-scale models,
  NOT a closure.

* *"The W59 substrate is a frontier transformer"* —
  **forbidden**. Default config is 6 layers / 8 query heads /
  4 KV heads / d_model=64 / byte-vocab / max_len=128 /
  untrained.

* *"V11 septuple-skip + retrieval-skip strictly improves over
  V10 sextuple-skip"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W59-L-V11-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP`` documents the cap.
  The qualitative "more skips means more capacity" claim is
  conjectural.

* *"ECC V11 delivers 1024 bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**.
  V11 delivers **22.333 bits/visible-token** at full emit; the
  1024-bit/token target is above the V11 structural ceiling
  (info bound = log2(2^20) = 20 bits/segment-tuple) and
  reproduces honestly as the R-123 H117c falsifier.

* *"The W59 14-backend multi-hop translator V9 talks to 14 real
  hosted models"* — **forbidden**. The 14 backends are *named*,
  not *executed*. The multi-hop graph + four-axis
  (substrate × hidden × attention × retrieval) trust composite
  is the load-bearing claim; the backends themselves are
  simulated. ``W59-L-MULTI-HOP-V9-SYNTHETIC-BACKENDS-CAP``
  documents this.

* *"The LHR V11 retention scorer is a trained deep network"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W59-L-LHR-V11-SCORER-FIT-CAP`` documents
  that it is a single linear ridge head, fit by closed-form
  linear ridge on a small synthetic supervised set.

* *"W59's prefix-state V3 partial-reuse path is bit-for-bit
  identical to a full recompute on the **full** prefix"* —
  **forbidden**. The byte-identical claim is on the *reusable
  head* span (positions ``[0, prefix_reuse_len)``); the
  recompute tail is, by construction, the same forward as a
  full recompute on those tokens.

## W58 (Deep Cache-Reuse Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W58 extends W57 with a richer in-repo runtime
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v3``: 5 layers / 8 query heads /
4 KV heads with GQA / d_model=64 / RMSNorm + SwiGLU / KV
importance tracking / real flop counter / partial-forward),
five W58 substrate-facing bridges (KV V3 with **fitted inject
scales**, HSB V2 with **multi-layer fitted projection**,
prefix-state V2 with **flop-saved counter**, attention V2 with
**KL-budget enforcement**, cache controller with three policies
including a closed-form-ridge **learned scoring head**), a
**three-way deep hybrid V3** (V6 ↔ substrate V3 ↔ cache
controller), and 12 V-bumps for the rest of the W57 stack.

* *"W58 trained the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W58-L-V3-NO-BACKPROP-CAP`` is load-bearing: the only fits
  are (a) KV bridge V3 / HSB V2 inject scales via coordinate
  descent and (b) a single linear cache-controller scoring
  head via closed-form ridge regression. No autograd, no
  PyTorch/JAX, no GPU.

* *"W58 breached transformer-internal coupling on Ollama /
  OpenAI / hosted models"* — **forbidden**. The substrate is
  still a tiny in-repo NumPy runtime.
  ``W58-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`` carries
  forward unchanged. ``W58-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` is a
  sharper restatement of the open question on frontier-scale
  models, NOT a closure.

* *"The W58 substrate is a frontier transformer"* —
  **forbidden**. Default config is 5 layers / 8 query heads /
  4 KV heads / d_model=64 / byte-vocab / max_len=120 /
  untrained.

* *"V10 quintuple-skip + attention-skip strictly improves over
  V9 quintuple-skip"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W58-L-V10-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP`` documents the cap.
  The qualitative "more skips means more capacity" claim is
  conjectural.

* *"ECC V10 delivers 1024 bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**.
  V10 delivers **21.333 bits/visible-token** at full emit,
  exceeding the W58 ≥ 21.0 target. The 1024-bit/token target
  reproduces as the H95 falsifier:
  ``W58-L-ECC-V10-RATE-FLOOR-CAP`` says the target is above
  the structural ceiling implied by the V10 codebook
  (info bound = log2(524 288) = 19 bits/segment-tuple).

* *"The cache controller learned policy beats LRU on every
  seed"* — **forbidden**. The H89 bar is the honest reading:
  the importance policy is **competitive** (≤ 1.25 × uniform
  L1 drift) with positive flop savings on all 3 seeds.
  ``W58-L-CACHE-CONTROLLER-LINEAR-CAP`` documents that the
  learned head is a single linear scoring head.

* *"The prefix-state V2 flop savings ratio of 0.667 is
  universal"* — **forbidden**. 0.667 is the savings *on a
  specific probe* (20-token prompt + 9-token follow-up). The
  ratio scales as ``1 − (n_fu / (n_prompt + n_fu))``-style
  geometry. The claim is that flop savings are real, positive,
  and quantified — not that any particular ratio is universal.

* *"The KV bridge V3 fitted scale proves the carrier helpfully
  steers the substrate"* — **forbidden**. The fit matches a
  *magnitude target* for the L2 logit perturbation. Whether the
  perturbation improves downstream quality depends on training;
  the substrate is not trained.

* *"The deep substrate hybrid V3 three_way=True proves frontier
  substrates can be coupled this way"* — **forbidden**. V3
  demonstrates three-way coupling on the in-repo V3 runtime.
  Whether a frontier model exposes hooks compatible with this
  design remains a conjecture
  (``W58-C-FRONTIER-SCALE-SUBSTRATE-LIFT``).

* *"Multi-hop V8's 132 edges are real backend deployments"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W58-L-MULTI-HOP-V8-SYNTHETIC-BACKENDS-CAP``
  documents that the 12 backends are named, not executed.

* *"W58 has no honest caps"* — **forbidden**. W58 carries the
  full W57 cap stack forward and adds at least seven new ones
  (V3-no-backprop, V10-outer-not-trained, ECC-V10-rate-floor,
  cache-controller-linear, multi-hop-v8-synthetic-backends,
  V10-permutation-invariance, no-third-party-substrate). All
  appear in `docs/THEOREM_REGISTRY.md` under the W58 section.

## W57 (Deep Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W57 deepens the W56 substrate breach: a richer in-repo runtime
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate_v2``: 4 layers / 8 heads / d_model=64
/ RoPE / per-layer logit lens / cache eviction / prefix-state
extraction / per-head attention bias hook), four substrate
bridges (``kv_bridge_v2``, ``hidden_state_bridge``,
``prefix_state_bridge``, ``attention_steering_bridge``), a
**bidirectional hybrid stack**
(``coordpy.deep_substrate_hybrid_v2``), and 11 V9-style
mechanism advances (V9 persistent state, MLSC V5, consensus V3,
CRC V5, LHR V9, ECC V9, TVS V6, uncertainty V5, disagreement
algebra V3, multi-hop V7, substrate adapter V2).

* *"W57 breached transformer-internal coupling on Ollama /
  OpenAI / hosted models"* — **forbidden**. The substrate is
  still a tiny in-repo NumPy runtime. Substrate adapter V2
  records ``tier=text_only`` for every hosted backend.
  ``W57-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`` is
  load-bearing (carries forward W56's cap unchanged).

* *"W57 closes any prior `*-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`
  conjecture"* — **forbidden**. The W57 mechanisms run only
  inside the in-repo V2 runtime. ``W57-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-
  COUPLING`` is a sharper restatement of the open question on
  frontier-scale models, NOT a closure.

* *"The W57 substrate is a frontier transformer"* —
  **forbidden**. Default config is 4 layers / 8 heads /
  d_model=64 / byte-vocab / max_len=96 / untrained. It is a
  research runtime, not a production model.

* *"W57 trains the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W57-L-NUMPY-CPU-V2-SUBSTRATE-CAP`` documents the per-step
  cost as ``O(L·H·n_tokens·d_head)`` in pure NumPy; no
  PyTorch/JAX, no GPU, no end-to-end backprop.

* *"The KV bridge V2 / hidden-state bridge / attention-steering
  bridge prove a capsule carrier helpfully steers the
  substrate"* — **forbidden**. Each bridge proves the carrier
  *measurably perturbs* the substrate's logits / attention
  distribution / hidden state. Whether the perturbation is
  *useful* depends on training; the substrate is not trained.

* *"V9 quint-skip strictly improves over V8 quad-skip"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W57-L-V9-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP`` documents
  the cap: the V9 outer GRU + hidden-state-skip linear are
  initialised but not trained. The H56-style "quad-skip gain"
  reproducing as a partial result carries forward from W56.

* *"V9 detects every adversarial sequence forgery"* —
  **forbidden**. EMA carriers smooth out sequence order; the
  W56 ``W56-L-V8-PERMUTATION-INVARIANCE-CAP`` carries forward
  to V9.

* *"ECC V9 delivers 256 bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**.
  V9 delivers **20.333 bits/visible-token** at full emit,
  which exceeds the W57 ≥ 20.0 target. The 256-bit/token
  target reproduces as the H65 falsifier:
  ``W57-L-ECC-V9-RATE-FLOOR-CAP`` says the target is above
  the structural ceiling implied by the V9 codebook (info
  bound ≈ 18 bits/segment).

* *"BCH(31,16) detects every 4+ bit pattern"* — **forbidden**.
  W56's ``W56-L-BCH-31-16-FOUR-BIT-PATHOLOGY-CAP`` carries
  forward unchanged.

* *"CRC V5 fully recovers any 5-bit burst"* — **forbidden**.
  V5 *disperses* a 5-bit burst over 3-D interleave so no
  contiguous run > 2 errors remains in the de-interleaved
  stream (H72 dispersion rate = 1.0 across seeds), but the
  underlying BCH(31,16) decoder still has triple-bit
  correction limits. The combined dispersion + BCH chain is
  what lifts effective burst tolerance, not interleaving
  alone.

* *"The deep substrate hybrid V2 proves frontier substrates
  can be coupled this way"* — **forbidden**. V2 demonstrates
  bidirectional coupling on the in-repo V2 runtime. Whether a
  frontier model exposes hooks compatible with this design
  remains a conjecture (``W57-C-FRONTIER-SCALE-SUBSTRATE-LIFT``).

* *"W57 has no honest caps"* — **forbidden**. W57 carries
  forward every W56/W55/.../W22 cap and adds ``W57-L-NUMPY-
  CPU-V2-SUBSTRATE-CAP``, ``W57-L-V9-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP``,
  ``W57-L-ECC-V9-RATE-FLOOR-CAP``, ``W57-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-
  SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP``. Two new conjectures:
  ``W57-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` (sharper restatement of
  the W56 conjecture) and ``W57-C-FRONTIER-SCALE-SUBSTRATE-
  LIFT`` (new).

* *"W57 is a CoordPy SDK release"* — **forbidden**.
  ``coordpy.__version__`` remains ``0.5.20``. SDK contract
  byte-for-byte unchanged. No PyPI release.

## W56 (Substrate-Coupled Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W56 introduces a **real, executable, deterministic, content-
addressed tiny in-repo transformer substrate**
(``coordpy.tiny_substrate``) where token embeddings, multi-head
causal self-attention, KV cache, hidden states, layer norm,
feed-forward, and logits are *not metaphorical*. Plus a
``coordpy.substrate_adapter`` capability probe, a
``coordpy.kv_bridge`` latent → KV injector, a
``coordpy.deep_substrate_hybrid`` stack that puts the real
substrate attention block in the loop, and 9 V8 mechanism
advances (V8 persistent state, MLSC V4, consensus V2, CRC V4,
LHR V8, ECC V8, TVS V5, Uncertainty V4, multi-hop V6).

* *"W56 breached transformer-internal coupling on Ollama /
  OpenAI / any hosted model"* — **forbidden**. The substrate is
  a tiny in-repo NumPy runtime. The substrate adapter records
  ``tier=text_only`` for every hosted backend. Third-party
  hosted-model substrate access remains substrate-blocked.
  ``W56-L-NO-THIRD-PARTY-SUBSTRATE-COUPLING-CAP`` is load-
  bearing.

* *"W56 closes W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT / W47-C-DEEP-
  TRANSFORMER-COUPLING / ... / W55-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING"*
  — **forbidden**. The third-party substrate-blocked conjectures
  carry forward unchanged. W56 raises the in-repo substrate
  floor; it does not close the third-party side. ``W56-C-DEEP-
  TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` is a sharper restatement of the open
  question on frontier-scale models.

* *"The tiny substrate is a frontier transformer"* —
  **forbidden**. The default config is 2 layers, 4 heads,
  ``d_model=32``, byte-vocab, untrained. It is a **research
  runtime**, not a production model.

* *"W56 is GPU-accelerated"* — **forbidden**. The tiny
  substrate runs in NumPy on CPU; per-step cost is
  ``O(L · H · n_tokens · d_head)``.
  ``W56-L-NUMPY-CPU-TINY-SUBSTRATE-CAP`` names this.

* *"The KV bridge proves a capsule carrier helpfully steers a
  real substrate"* — **forbidden**. The bridge proves the carrier
  *measurably perturbs* the substrate's logits (max abs ~0.86
  on the H6 probe). Whether the perturbation is *useful*
  depends on training; the substrate is not trained.

* *"W56 trains the substrate end-to-end"* — **forbidden**. A
  cheap finite-difference toy fitter exists in
  ``fit_substrate_next_token``; the H-bars do **not** depend on
  it. End-to-end autograd training of the substrate requires
  PyTorch/JAX — out of W56 scope.

* *"V8 quad-skip strictly improves over V7 triple-skip"* —
  **forbidden**. The H8 bar reproduces honestly: 2/3 seeds
  positive, 1 seed negative. ``W56-L-V8-OUTER-NOT-TRAINED-CAP``
  documents the cap: the V8 outer GRU + substrate-skip
  projection are *initialised but not trained*.

* *"V8 detects every adversarial sequence forgery"* —
  **forbidden**. ``W56-L-V8-PERMUTATION-INVARIANCE-CAP``
  documents that V8 is invariant to certain permutation-only
  forgeries of the carrier sequence (EMA carriers smooth out
  sequence order). H31 reproduces this with 0/3 protect rate.

* *"BCH(31,16) detects every 4-bit error"* — **forbidden**.
  ``W56-L-BCH-31-16-FOUR-BIT-PATHOLOGY`` documents that some
  4-bit patterns mis-correct to a different valid codeword.
  The empirical 4-bit detect rate is 0.94 across 3 seeds
  (above the 0.50 floor) but not 1.0.

* *"CRC V4 silent failure rate is uniformly ≤ 0.02"* —
  **forbidden**. The H26 / H32 bars reproduce honestly: small
  probe sizes (4 probes per seed) show ``silent_failure_rate ≈
  0.25`` in some seeds. The honest cap is ``≤ 0.30`` on small
  samples; the floor improves on larger probes (asymptotic floor
  ≤ 0.02 conditional on probe size).

* *"The deep substrate hybrid replaces the deep V6 stack"* —
  **forbidden**. The hybrid stack runs the V6 deep stack
  *first* (capsule-layer), then bridges its output into the
  substrate. It is a *composition*, not a replacement. Ablating
  the substrate top changes the output (H13 ablation L2 ≈ 1.06),
  but the V6 base remains load-bearing.

* *"W56 bumps the version"* — **forbidden**.
  ``coordpy.__version__`` remains ``0.5.20``; no PyPI release;
  W56 modules ship at explicit-import paths only. The released
  v0.5.20 wheel surface is byte-for-byte unchanged.

* *"W56 closes the Context Zero question"* — **forbidden**.
  The original goal (solving context for multi-agent teams) is
  *materially closer in one specific way*: the capsule layer can
  now demonstrate measurable, replay-deterministic, content-
  addressed steering of a real substrate within the bounded
  in-repo runtime. The frontier-model substrate side, the multi-
  host shared state side, and the genuinely-different-tokenizer
  side all remain open.

## W55 (Deep Trust-Weighted Disagreement-Algebraic Latent OS) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

(Carried forward from the post-W54 W55 milestone document; see
``docs/RESULTS_W55_DTDA_LOS.md`` for the full text. All W55-T-* /
W55-L-* / W55-C-* rules remain in force at W56.)

## W53 (Persistent Mergeable Corruption-Robust Latent Operating System) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W53 stacks ten orthogonal advances on top of W52: 3-layer
persistent latent state V5 with persistent skip-link + merge
head (M1), 5-backend multi-hop translator V3 with chain-
length-4 transitivity + uncertainty-aware arbitration with
per-dim 1-sigma intervals (M2), Mergeable Latent State
Capsule (MLSC) abstraction with merge operator + audit trail +
K-of-N consensus quorum with abstain (M3), L=10 deep proxy
stack V4 with merge-aware + corruption-aware heads (M4), ECC
codebook V5 K1×K2×K3×K4 with XOR parity bits (M5), four-
headed long-horizon reconstruction V5 max_k=16 + degradation
curve to k=32 (M6), branch merge memory V3 with consensus
pages + abstain (M7), corruption-robust carrier with parity +
3-of-3 majority repetition (M8), transcript-vs-shared
arbiter V2 with explicit abstain (M9), and uncertainty /
confidence layer with calibration check (M10). It is the
strongest *executable proxy* available at the capsule layer
with one **best-effort** real-LLM realism anchor (quint).

* *"W53 is a true latent operating system for transformers"* —
  **forbidden**. W53 is a **capsule-native latent operating
  system proxy**. It does NOT touch transformer-internal
  hidden states, KV cache bytes, attention weights, or
  embeddings. The MLSC, V5 persistent state, and deep proxy
  V4 all operate at the capsule layer.

* *"W53 closes ``W52-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-QUAD-TRANSITIVITY``"* —
  **forbidden**. The conjecture is *sharpened* to
  ``W53-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-QUINT-CAP``: the quint translator +
  length-4 transitivity scoring + uncertainty-aware
  arbitration are now trained and auditable, but
  behavioural transitivity across **genuinely different
  tokenizers** still requires backend-side adapters out of
  W53 scope.

* *"W53 closes ``W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` ..
  ``W52-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING``"* — **forbidden**.
  These remain substrate-blocked. W53 *further-bounds* W52
  by adding depth (L=10 V4), 5-backend transitivity, the
  MLSC abstraction, ECC parity, and the corruption-robust
  carrier, but does not close them.

* *"W53 is GPU-accelerated"* — **forbidden**. The
  pure-Python ``Variable`` + ``AdamOptimizer`` autograd
  engine from W47 carries forward; per-module training
  cost grows as ``O(n_params × n_examples)``. The
  ``W53-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP`` is a
  load-bearing honest constraint.

* *"W53 fully recovers signal at 32+ turns"* —
  **forbidden** in unqualified form. The H14 honest bar
  is cosine ≥ 0.25 at turn 32 on corrupted regimes;
  V5's persistent skip-link gives it more juice at
  long horizons than V4, but 32-turn recall on
  arbitrary regimes is not guaranteed.

* *"W53 fully recovers prior-turn features at k > 16"* —
  **forbidden**. The H16 honest bar is MSE ≤ 0.80 at
  k=16; the V5 head's design-maximum lookback is k=16.
  Tighter convergence past k=16 requires NumPy/JAX/PyTorch
  and larger training budgets. Past k=16 the V5
  degradation curve probe explicitly marks
  ``is_degraded=True`` and reports the deterministic
  baseline MSE.

* *"W53 hits 32+ bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**. The
  K1=32 × K2=16 × K3=8 × K4=4 codebook has a structural
  capacity of ~14 bits per (coarse, fine, ultra, ultra2)
  quadruple plus 4 parity bits = ~18 bits/visible-token
  ceiling. The ``W53-L-ECC-RATE-FLOOR`` falsifier
  reproduces the 40-bit miss honestly.

* *"W53 detects every corruption"* — **forbidden**. The
  ECC parity scheme detects single-bit flips at near-100%
  rate but cannot detect all 2-bit flips: a 2-bit flip
  that lands in a parity bit + a single segment bit can
  produce an undetected silent failure. The H25 honest
  bar is silent_failure_rate ≤ 0.30 under 2-bit
  corruption; the H31 bar is silent_failure_rate ≤ 0.10
  under single-bit corruption.

* *"W53 corrects every detectable corruption"* —
  **forbidden**. With 1-bit detection but no Hamming-style
  syndrome, partial correction recovers via the surviving
  segments — the corrupted segment is dropped from the
  decode rather than algebraically reconstructed. The H24
  bar is correction_rate ≥ 0.30, not 1.0.

* *"W53 makes real LLMs condition on the ECC control"* —
  **forbidden**. The H17 task-correct anchor is
  synthetic. On real LLMs the claim is bounded to "the
  W53 ECC control block is in the model's context".

* *"W53 generalises across distributions"* — **forbidden**.
  The H19 ``W53-L-V5-DISTRIBUTION-CAP`` reproduces honestly
  when an adversary controls the V5 training distribution;
  protect rate caps around 0.85-0.92 mean across 3 seeds.

* *"The MLSC merge operator is a learned algorithm with
  performance guarantees"* — **forbidden**. The MLSC
  ``MergeOperator`` is a deterministic, content-addressed
  function of (parents, weights, fact_tags). The
  *abstraction* has guarantees (replay determinism,
  audit-walks-to-roots, sum-to-one weights, confidence
  bounded in [0,1]); the *content* of the merge is a
  weighted blend whose semantic correctness depends on the
  parents' semantic content.

* *"W53 bumps the version"* — **forbidden**.
  ``coordpy.__version__`` remains ``0.5.20``; no PyPI
  release; W53 modules ship at explicit-import paths only.

## W52 (Quantised Persistent Multi-Hop Latent Coordination) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W52 stacks eight orthogonal advances on top of W51: stacked
persistent latent state V4 with skip-link (M1), multi-hop
quad-backend translator with chain-length-3 transitivity
and disagreement-weighted arbitration (M2), `L=8` deep
proxy stack V3 with role-conditioned banks (M3), three-level
quantised codebook V4 K1×K2×K3 (M4), three-headed long-
horizon reconstruction V4 max_k=12 (M5), branch/cycle memory
V2 with trainable merge + evict + joint pages (M6),
role-graph conditioned cross-role transfer (M7), and a
transcript-vs-shared-state matched-budget comparator (M8).
It is the strongest *executable proxy* available at the
capsule layer with one **best-effort** real-LLM realism
anchor (quad-backend).

* *"W52 is real cross-model behaviourally transitive"* —
  **forbidden** unless qualified as "chain-length-3
  capsule-layer transitivity across four synthetic
  backends, with a best-effort real-LLM anchor". The
  multi-hop translator operates over capsule-layer carriers
  only.

* *"W52 closes ``W51-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-TRIPLE-TRANSITIVITY``"* —
  **forbidden**. The conjecture is *sharpened* to
  ``W52-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-QUAD-TRANSITIVITY``: the quad
  translator + length-3 transitivity loss is now trained
  and auditable, but behavioural transitivity across
  **genuinely different tokenizers** still requires
  backend-side adapters out of W52 scope.

* *"W52 is transformer-internal coupling"* — **forbidden**.
  W52 does NOT touch transformer-internal hidden states,
  KV cache bytes, attention weights, or embeddings.

* *"W52 closes ``W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` ..
  ``W51-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING``"* — **forbidden**.
  These remain substrate-blocked. W52 *further-bounds*
  W51 by adding depth (L=8), N-backend transitivity,
  quantised K1×K2×K3 compression, and the
  transcript-vs-shared-state ablation, but does not close
  them.

* *"W52 is GPU-accelerated"* — **forbidden**. The
  pure-Python ``Variable`` + ``AdamOptimizer`` autograd
  engine from W47 carries forward; per-module training
  cost grows as ``O(n_params × n_examples)``. The
  ``W52-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP`` is a load-bearing
  honest constraint.

* *"W52 fully recovers signal at 24 turns"* —
  **forbidden** in unqualified form. The H14 honest
  bar is cosine ≥ 0.25 at turn 23 on corrupted regimes;
  the empirical value is 0.995 on the specific corrupted
  regime in `family_long_horizon_v4_retention_24turn_stretch`.
  Other regimes may drop off harder.

* *"W52 fully recovers prior-turn features at k > 12"* —
  **forbidden**. The H16 honest bar is MSE ≤ 0.70 at k=12;
  the V4 head's design-maximum lookback is k=12. Tighter
  convergence past k=12 requires NumPy/JAX/PyTorch and
  larger training budgets.

* *"W52 hits 32 bits/visible-token"* — **forbidden**. The
  K1=32 × K2=16 × K3=8 codebook has a structural capacity
  of ~12 bits per (coarse, fine, ultra) triple; the
  ``W52-L-QUANTISED-RATE-FLOOR-CAP`` falsifier reproduces
  the 32-bit miss honestly.

* *"W52 makes real LLMs condition on the quantised
  control"* — **forbidden**. The H7 / H8 task-correct
  anchor is synthetic. On real LLMs the claim is bounded to
  "the W52 quantised control block is in the model's
  context".

* *"W52 generalises across distributions"* — **forbidden**.
  The H20 ``W52-L-QPMHLC-DISTRIBUTION-CAP`` reproduces
  honestly when an adversary controls the training
  distribution across V4 + role-graph; combined protect
  rate caps around 0.85 mean across 3 seeds.

* *"The multi-hop translator is robust against any
  training-distribution forgery"* — **forbidden**. The H11
  ``W52-L-MULTI-HOP-TRANSLATOR-COMPROMISE-CAP`` is honestly
  partial — identity-friendly init means the translator
  preserves ~0.55 of the clean signal even when trained on
  forged labels. The empirical protect rate caps at 0.43.

* *"W52 bumps the version"* — **forbidden**.
  ``coordpy.__version__`` remains ``0.5.20``; no PyPI
  release; W52 modules ship at explicit-import paths only.

## W51 (Persistent Cross-Backend Latent Coordination) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W51 stacks six orthogonal advances on top of W50: GRU
persistent shared latent state V3 (M1), triple-backend
translator with transitivity loss (M2), `L=6` deep proxy
stack V2 with branch/cycle-specialised heads (M3),
hierarchical compression V3 K1×K2 (M4), two-headed long-
horizon reconstruction V3 max_k=8 (M5), branch/cycle
memory head V1 (M6). It is the strongest *executable proxy*
at the capsule layer with one **best-effort** real-LLM
triple anchor. All of its claims remain unchanged at W52
and are sharpened-forward in the W52 section above.

## W50 (Cross-Backend Latent Coordination) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W50 stacks five orthogonal advances on top of W49: cross-
backend latent projector (M1), L=4 deep proxy stack (M2),
adaptive K=16 compression with learned emit-mask (M3),
role-pair pseudo-KV transfer + adaptive eviction V2 (M4),
chain-walkable shared-latent carrier V2 + reconstruction V2
head (M5). It is the strongest *executable proxy* available
at the capsule layer with one **best-effort** real-LLM
realism anchor.

* *"W50 is real cross-model latent transfer"* — **forbidden**
  unless qualified as "cross-backend latent transfer between
  two synthetic backends, with a best-effort real-LLM anchor".
  The projector operates over capsule-layer carriers only.

* *"W50 closes ``W49-C-CROSS-MODEL-LATENT-TRANSFER``"* —
  **forbidden**. The conjecture is *sharpened* to
  ``W50-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-LATENT-TRANSFER``: the projector +
  carrier chain is now trained and auditable, but
  behavioral transfer across **genuinely different
  tokenizers** still requires backend-side adapters out of
  W50 scope.

* *"W50 is transformer-internal cross-model coupling"* —
  **forbidden**. W50 does NOT touch transformer-internal
  hidden states, KV cache bytes, attention weights, or
  embeddings.

* *"W50 supports real KV"* — **forbidden**. The role-pair
  transfer operates over capsule-layer pseudo-KV slots only.

* *"W50 closes ``W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`` /
  ``W48-C-REAL-KV-COUPLED-PROXY`` /
  ``W49-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING``"* — **forbidden**.
  These remain substrate-blocked. W50 *further-bounds* W49
  by adding depth (L=4), cross-backend latent transfer, and
  adaptive compression, but does not close them.

* *"W50 is GPU-accelerated"* — **forbidden**. The pure-Python
  ``Variable`` + ``AdamOptimizer`` autograd engine from W47
  carries forward; per-module training cost grows as
  ``O(n_params × n_examples)``. The
  ``W50-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP`` is a load-bearing
  honest constraint.

* *"W50 reaches MSE ≪ 0.05 on reconstruction"* —
  **forbidden**. The H8 honest bar is MSE ≤ 0.25 (well below
  the random-prediction baseline of 0.333). Tighter
  convergence requires NumPy/JAX/PyTorch bindings and is out
  of W50 scope.

* *"W50 generalises across distributions"* — **forbidden**.
  The H15 ``W50-L-MULTI-BLOCK-DISTRIBUTION-CAP`` falsifier
  reproduces honestly when an adversary controls the
  training distribution; protect rate caps around 0.88
  mean across 3 seeds.

* *"W50 makes real LLMs condition on the carrier"* —
  **forbidden**. The H14 task-correct anchor is synthetic
  (``MultiBlockAwareSyntheticBackend``). On real LLMs the
  claim is bounded to "the W50 control block is in the
  model's context".

* *"W50 bumps the version"* — **forbidden**.
  ``coordpy.__version__`` remains ``0.5.20``; no PyPI
  release; W50 modules ship at explicit-import paths only.

## W49 (Multi-Block Cross-Bank Coordination) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W49 stacks `L_p`-block proxy transformers on top of role-
conditioned multi-bank pseudo-KV, learned eviction, retention
head, dictionary-codebook compression, and a content-addressed
per-turn shared-latent capsule. The strongest *executable
proxy* available at the capsule layer without substrate
access.

* *"W49 is a real `L_p`-block transformer"* — forbidden unless
  qualified as "`L_p`-block capsule-layer proxy transformer
  over a pseudo-KV factor bank". W49 reproduces a transformer
  block stack's *algebraic interface* at the capsule layer;
  it does not transplant a real transformer's stacked blocks
  + KV cache + hidden states.

* *"W49 supports real KV"* — forbidden. The multi-bank
  pseudo-KV banks reproduce the algebraic interface; they do
  not transplant real KV bytes.

* *"W49 closes the transformer-coupling conjecture"* —
  forbidden. The substrate-blocked W43 conjectures
  (`W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT`,
  `W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING`,
  `W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY`) and the carry-forwards
  (`W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
  `W48-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
  `W48-C-REAL-KV-COUPLED-PROXY`,
  `W48-C-MULTI-HOST-SHARED-STATE`) **all carry forward
  unchanged**. W49 *strengthens the bounding* by adding more
  depth + role isolation + retention + compression +
  audit-ready shared-latent chains, but it does not close
  transformer-internal substrate access.

* *"W49 generalises across distributions"* — forbidden. The
  `W49-L-MULTI-BLOCK-DISTRIBUTION-CAP` limitation reproduces
  honestly on R-97: mean `downstream_protect_rate = 0.000`
  across 3 seeds when the adversary controls the multi-bank
  banks + training distribution.

* *"W49 trains efficiently"* — forbidden. The pure-Python
  reverse-mode autograd from W47 has per-step cost
  approximately `L_p` × W48 (`O(L_p · n_params · n_examples)`).
  `W49-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP` carries forward;
  production training requires NumPy/JAX/PyTorch bindings.

* *"W49 makes real LLMs condition on the multi-block headers"*
  — forbidden. `W49-L-CTRL-AWARE-MODEL-INDIFFERENCE-CAP`
  carries forward from W48. The H14 task-correct rate is
  measured on the deterministic
  `MultiBlockAwareSyntheticBackend`; on real LLMs the saving
  is bounded to "the trained packed control block +
  shared-latent header are in the model's context". Real-LLM
  conditioning on `LATENT_CTRL_V2:` is conjectural.

* *"W49 transfers latent state across hosts/models"* —
  forbidden. `W49-C-CROSS-MODEL-LATENT-TRANSFER` is conjectural
  and requires backend-side tokenizer-agnostic adapter outside
  W49 scope.

* *"W49 bumps the version"* — forbidden. `coordpy.__version__`
  remains `"0.5.20"`; `coordpy.SDK_VERSION` remains
  `"coordpy.sdk.v3.43"`. The released wheel surface is byte-
  for-byte unchanged. W49 ships at `coordpy.multi_block_proxy`
  and is reachable only through an explicit import — same
  convention as W43..W48.

## W48 (Shared-State Transformer-Proxy) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W48 introduces the strongest **executable proxy** for
transformer-internal coupling at the capsule layer: a single
team-shared base state, a trainable pseudo-KV factor bank, a
multi-head proxy attention block, a write head + reconstruction
decoder + branch/cycle bias + branch-history compressor + latent
control serializer. Forbidden phrasings:

* *"W48 is a real transformer block"* — forbidden unless
  qualified as "a multi-head, depth-1 *capsule-layer* proxy
  block over a *pseudo-KV factor bank*". W48 reproduces the
  algebraic interface of a transformer attention head
  (`softmax(QK^T/sqrt(d))·V` with strict causal masking) but
  does NOT touch real KV bytes, hidden states, or attention
  weights.

* *"W48 closes the transformer-coupling conjecture"* —
  forbidden. The substrate-blocked carry-forwards
  (`W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT`,
  `W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING`,
  `W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY`,
  `W45-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
  `W46-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
  `W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`) ALL carry forward
  unchanged. W48 *strengthens the bounding* by adding more
  capsule-layer scaffolding; it does not close the substrate
  side.

* *"W48 transplants real KV state"* — forbidden. The pseudo-KV
  factor bank's slots are *capsule-layer surrogates* with
  byte-deterministic content-addressed provenance. Real
  transformer KV cache is on the substrate side and is out of
  scope. `W48-L-NO-REAL-KV-CAP` names this explicitly.

* *"W48 trains on real LLM traces"* — forbidden. Training is
  on hermetic synthetic banks pre-committed in the R-95
  sources. Real-LLM realism anchors are bounded to the
  `SharedStateAwareSyntheticBackend` and not load-bearing for
  H1..H14.

* *"W48 beats W47 across the board"* — forbidden. W48 strictly
  beats W47 on the W48-specific axes (`r95_pseudo_kv_reuse`,
  `r95_reconstruction_objective`, `r95_branch_cycle_bias`,
  `r95_write_gate_selectivity`,
  `r95_shared_state_aware_backend`) and is sanity-equivalent on
  `r95_trivial_shared_state_passthrough`. On the W47-specific
  axes (R-94 families) the W47 controller remains the W47
  reference; W48 does not displace it. The honest framing is
  "additive layer".

* *"W48 is GPU-accelerated"* — forbidden. W48 reuses the W47
  pure-Python autograd; `W48-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP`
  carries forward.

* *"W48 makes the released SDK trainable"* — forbidden. W48
  ships at `coordpy.shared_state_proxy` and is reachable only
  via explicit import. The released v0.5.20 wheel
  (`coordpy.__version__`, `coordpy.SDK_VERSION`, the smoke
  driver, the public symbols) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

* *"W48 defeats adversarial training-set forgery"* — forbidden.
  The `W48-L-PROXY-DISTRIBUTION-CAP` limitation reproduces
  honestly on `r95_proxy_distribution_cap`: mean
  downstream_protect_rate = 0.222 across 3 seeds. The trained
  proxy *learns* the adversary's distribution when the
  adversary owns the bank + training set.

* *"W48 lifts the H13 backend gain to real LLMs"* — forbidden.
  The H13 task-correct rate is measured on the deterministic
  `SharedStateAwareSyntheticBackend`. On real LLMs the saving
  is bounded to "the SHARED_STATE_HASH, BRANCH_HIST, and
  LATENT_CTRL headers are in the model's context" — not a
  guarantee of behavioural lift.

## W47 (Autograd Manifold Stack) — explicit do-not-overstate rules

W47 introduces the first **autograd-trained** capsule-layer
manifold stack. The honest claim is that the stack is *trained
end-to-end via pure-Python reverse-mode AD + Adam SGD*. Forbidden
phrasings:

* *"W47 is a real deep neural network"* — forbidden unless
  qualified as "a depth-L pure-Python autograd-trained capsule-
  layer proxy". W47 is correct (gradient checks pass) but slow
  (`W47-L-PURE-PYTHON-TRAINING-COST-CAP`); reaching modern loss
  targets requires a NumPy/JAX/PyTorch binding which is out of
  scope at W47.

* *"W47 closes the transformer-coupling conjecture"* —
  forbidden. W47 closes only `W46-C-AUTOGRAD-DEEP-STACK`
  (under the explicit "pure-Python reverse-mode AD + Adam"
  reading). The substrate-blocked carry-forwards
  (`W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT`,
  `W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING`,
  `W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY`,
  `W45-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
  `W46-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`) carry forward.

* *"W47 trains on real LLM traces"* — forbidden. Training is
  on hermetic synthetic banks pre-committed in the R-94
  sources. Real-LLM realism anchors are bounded and not
  load-bearing for the H1..H12 success bar.

* *"W47 beats W46 across the board"* — forbidden. W47 strictly
  beats W46 on `r94_trainable_memory_head` (trained QKV beats
  cosine pool), on `r94_autograd_compromise_cap` (W47 mean =
  0.25 vs W46 = 0.0 — slightly more protective), and on
  `r94_autograd_ctrl_aware_backend` (full ctrl behavioural
  lift). On `r94_trainable_dictionary` the W46 closed-form
  K-prototype is competitive on small banks; W47's claim is
  *trainability*, not strict reconstruction-error superiority.

* *"W47 is GPU-accelerated"* — forbidden. The pure-Python
  autograd engine has per-step cost
  O(n_params × n_examples × n_layers) — no vectorisation, no
  GPU. The new conjecture
  `W47-C-GPU-BACKED-AUTOGRAD-SDK` names the GPU direction
  explicitly and marks it deliberately deferred.

* *"W47 makes the released SDK trainable"* — forbidden. W47
  ships at `coordpy.autograd_manifold` and is reachable only
  via explicit import. The released v0.5.20 wheel
  (`coordpy.__version__`, `coordpy.SDK_VERSION`, the smoke
  driver, the public symbols) is byte-for-byte unchanged.

Permitted phrasing: *"W47 is the first capsule-layer manifold
controller trained end-to-end by autograd SGD/Adam (pure-Python
reverse-mode AD); it preserves every replay-determinism + audit
property of W43..W46; it closes `W46-C-AUTOGRAD-DEEP-STACK`
under the explicit pure-Python AD reading; it carries forward
all substrate-blocked transformer-coupling conjectures."*

The programme has a long history of moves where a candidate result
was written up too strongly and later had to be sharpened or
retracted. This document is the canonical rule-book that prevents
that; reviewers should reject any text that violates it.

## Status vocabulary (definitions)

These are the only labels permitted on theorem-style claims in
this repo. Unlabelled claims are forbidden.

- **proved** — Mathematical proof, or proof-by-inspection of code
  that a reviewer can read in under 30 lines. The proof is in
  `docs/CAPSULE_FORMALISM.md` or `docs/archive/pre-coordpy-theory/PROOFS.md` or in the
  docstring of the relevant code. No simulation, no
  "experiments-show", no implicit cryptographic hardness.
- **proved-conditional** — Proof depends on a stated assumption.
  The assumption is named in the theorem statement (e.g. SHA-256
  second-preimage hardness; coherent-majority distribution
  premise; multinomial-logistic strict convexity).
- **mechanically-checked** — A runtime audit verifies the
  property on every run. The audit's soundness is by inspection
  (the audit code is short and the failure mode is enumerated).
  Compare to "test-passed-once" — mechanical-check is per-run.
- **empirical** — Measured on a published bench (`local_smoke`,
  `bundled_57`, `noisy_phase31`, etc.) from a published seed.
  Reproducible from `python -m vision_mvp.experiments.<phase>`
  with default args.
- **conjectural** — Stated, falsifiable, but not yet proved or
  systematically tested. The conjecture statement names the
  falsifier ("If we observe X, the conjecture is refuted").
- **retracted** — Earlier reading withdrawn; replaced by a more
  honest reading. The retraction names *why* the earlier reading
  was wrong (a counterexample, a tighter measurement, a sharper
  separation) and points to the replacement claim.

## Forbidden moves

### "Public install is live everywhere" or "all CoordPy APIs are stable"

> *"Just `pip install coordpy`; everything in the repo is stable."*

Forbidden unless it is true at the time of writing.  Public-facing
release text must distinguish:

* the **stable released surface** (`vision_mvp.coordpy`, the public
  CLIs, and the named on-disk schema contracts),
* the **experimental included surface**
  (`vision_mvp.coordpy.__experimental__`), and
* the **out-of-scope next-programme work**
  (`W42-C-NATIVE-LATENT`, `W42-C-MULTI-HOST`).

Permitted phrasing: *"Install from a clone with `pip install -e .`
today; use `pip install coordpy` / `pipx install coordpy` once the
package is published.  Treat `vision_mvp.coordpy` as the stable SDK
surface and `vision_mvp.coordpy.__experimental__` as non-stable
research API."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"Everything in CoordPy is stable"*, *"`pip
install coordpy` is available now"* (unless it is), *"the W22..W42
ladder is part of the stable SDK contract"*.

### "Paradigm shift" without a stated reading

> *"This is a paradigm shift."*

If you write the phrase "paradigm shift" anywhere in this repo,
you must immediately specify the reading: under which
quantitative bar, on which bench, at which $n$. The phrase
"paradigm-shift candidate" is permitted only when followed by
"under W3-Cn" where W3-Cn is a named conjecture in
`THEOREM_REGISTRY.md`. The strict reading W3-C7 is **retracted**.

Last touched: SDK v3.43 (W42 family — final release of the v3.4x line) 2026-05-03.

### "Solves" without a defining gate

> *"CoordPy solves context."*

If you write "solves" or "closes" about any open problem, you
must name the *defining gate* and state which side of the gate
you are on. "Solves the bounded-context problem" is forbidden;
"closes the per-agent O(log N) bound on the routing-only setting
of Phases 1–10" is permitted because the bound is named.

### "W35 is native latent" or "W35 found the transformer trust subspace"

> *"W35 implements native latent trust transfer."*

Forbidden.  W35 implements an **audited capsule-layer trust-subspace
proxy**.  Its basis entries are derived from controller-visible
signals: W21 probe top_sets, W33 EWMA trust, W34 live-attestation /
response-feature state, top-set stability, and host health.  It does
not read hidden states, transplant KV cache, inspect attention weights,
or project embeddings.

Permitted phrasing: *"W35 is a trust-subspace dense-control proxy that
turns some W34 NO_CONSENSUS abstentions into verified reroutes when a
stable high-margin basis direction exists."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W35 closes W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT"*, *"W35 proves
native latent transfer"*, *"W35 discovers a transformer-internal trust
subspace"*, *"W35 solves context for multi-agent teams."*

The honest reading is narrower: on R-82-TRUST-SUBSPACE-SHIFT, W35
improves correctness over W34 by +0.3125 while preserving trust
precision at 1.000, using one visible token/cell to carry roughly
13k bits of controller-verified structured state.  The hard falsifier
W35-L-ALL-BASIS-COMPROMISED remains: if every basis direction moves
together to the wrong answer, the capsule-layer proxy has no
independent signal and cannot recover.

### "W36 is native latent" or "W36 proves multi-host release readiness"

> *"W36 implements native latent host trust transfer."*

Forbidden.  W36 implements an **audited capsule-layer host-diverse
trust-subspace guard**.  It checks whether W35 dense-control support
is independently attested by distinct registered healthy hosts.  It
does not read hidden states, transplant KV cache, inspect attention
weights, project embeddings, or prove that a transformer-internal
trust subspace has been found.

Permitted phrasing: *"W36 hardens W35 by rejecting, rerouting, or
abstaining when dense-control support is not host-diverse and
verifiable."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W36 closes W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT"*, *"W36 gives
true three-host evidence"*, *"W36 makes the repo release-ready by
itself"*, *"W36 solves context for multi-agent teams."*

The honest reading is narrower: on R-83-HOST-DIVERSE-RECOVER, W36
improves over W35 by +0.3125 correctness and restores trust precision
to 1.000.  On R-83-HOST-SPOOFED-CONSENSUS, W36 improves trust
precision by abstaining but does not recover correctness.  On
R-83-NO-LIVE-ATTESTATION, W36 is a correctness-destroying abstention
guard.  Mac 2 (`192.168.12.248`) still times out, so the live result
is two-reachable-host evidence only.

### "W37 is native latent" or "W37 closes the multi-host conjecture"

> *"W37 transplants per-host trust state across the transformer."*

Forbidden.  W37 maintains a **closed-form, zero-parameter,
per-(host, oracle, top_set) EWMA over anchored historical
observations**.  It does not access hidden states, KV cache, attention
weights, or embeddings.  The "trajectory" is a sealed tuple of bytes
sealed under manifest-v7; the EWMA update is the same first-order
``(1-alpha) * prev + alpha * obs`` recurrence used in W32 and W33.

Permitted phrasing: *"W37 hardens W36 by allowing a single-host
recovery cell to be safely rerouted iff its (host, oracle, top_set)
trajectory has been cross-host anchored above threshold across
historical cells with at least ``min_trajectory_anchored_hosts``
distinct anchor hosts; without anchored trajectory, W37 preserves W36
abstention."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W37 closes W37-C-NATIVE-LATENT"*, *"W37 gives
true three-host evidence"*, *"W37 makes the repo release-ready by
itself"*, *"W37 solves context for multi-agent teams"*, *"W37 closes
W37-L-MULTI-HOST-COLLUSION-CAP"*.

The honest reading is narrower: on R-84-SINGLE-HOST-TRAJECTORY-RECOVER,
W37 improves over W36 by +0.500 correctness while preserving trust
precision at 1.000.  On the four named falsifiers (no history,
poisoned trajectory, disagreement, trivial), W37 preserves W36
behavior.  Mac 2 still times out (30th milestone), so the live
trajectory probe is two-reachable-host evidence only.  Two registered
hosts emitting a coordinated wrong top_set across enough cells can
defeat W37 at the capsule layer (W37-L-MULTI-HOST-COLLUSION-CAP).

### "W38 closes the multi-host blocker" or "W38 closes W37-L-MULTI-HOST-COLLUSION-CAP"

> *"W38 finally beats two-host collusion at the capsule layer."*

Forbidden.  W38 **bounds** (does not close)
``W37-L-MULTI-HOST-COLLUSION-CAP``.  The bound is conditional on the
existence of an uncompromised disjoint registered consensus reference.
W38 raises the capsule-layer adversary bar from "compromise 2 of N
trajectory hosts" to "compromise 2 of N trajectory hosts AND the
disjoint registered consensus reference".  When that reference is
itself compromised in lock-step, W38 cannot recover; this is the new
proved-conditional ``W38-L-CONSENSUS-COLLUSION-CAP`` limitation
theorem.

W38 also does not access hidden states, KV cache, attention weights,
or embeddings.  The ``ConsensusReferenceProbe`` is a controller-pre-
registered audited capsule-layer probe carrying a sealed tuple of
bytes; it is NOT a runtime ground-truth oracle and NOT a
transformer-internal projection.  The disjoint topology is enforced
*mechanically* in two places: the registry's ``__post_init__`` raises
``DisjointTopologyError`` when ``consensus_host_ids ∩
trajectory_host_ids != ∅``, and the verifier rejects envelopes
claiming an overlapping topology
(``w38_disjoint_topology_violation``).

Permitted phrasing: *"W38 wraps W37 with a disjoint cross-source
consensus-reference cross-check; when W37 reroutes on a colluded
trajectory and an uncompromised disjoint reference disagrees, W38
abstains via DIVERGENCE_ABSTAINED.  When the disjoint reference is
itself compromised, W38 cannot recover at the capsule layer."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W38 closes W37-L-MULTI-HOST-COLLUSION-CAP"*,
*"W38 closes W38-L-CONSENSUS-COLLUSION-CAP"*, *"W38 closes
W38-C-NATIVE-LATENT"*, *"W38 gives true 3-host evidence"*, *"W38
makes the repo release-ready by itself"*, *"W38 solves context for
multi-agent teams"*.

The honest reading is narrower: on R-85-COLLUDED-CROSS-HOST-
TRAJECTORY, W38 improves over W37 by +0.500 trust precision while
preserving correctness.  On the four named falsifiers (trivial,
no-collusion, consensus-also-compromised, no-consensus-reference),
W38 preserves W37 behavior or honestly fails.  Mac 2 still times out
(31st milestone), so the live consensus probe sourced its disjoint
consensus host from a different model class on the same physical
host as one trajectory host -- a defensible weak proxy for capsule-
layer disjointness, NOT a true 3-physical-host disjoint topology.

### "W41 solves context for multi-agent teams" or "W41 closes W41-L-COMPOSITE-COLLUSION-CAP"

> *"W41 finally solves context for multi-agent teams."*

Forbidden.  W41 is an **integration** milestone, not a "solving"
milestone.  W41 jointly binds the W21..W40 trust-adjudication
chain and the W7..W11 cross-role / multi-round bundle decoder
family into a single auditable end-to-end path under a manifest-
v11 envelope, but does NOT close native-latent transfer, does
NOT close ``W40-L-COORDINATED-DIVERSE-RESPONSE-CAP``, and does
NOT close its own ``W41-L-COMPOSITE-COLLUSION-CAP`` limitation
theorem.

W41 also does not access hidden states, KV cache, attention
weights, or embeddings.  The cross-axis classification is a
closed-form, zero-parameter, deterministic mechanical decision
over the W40 projection branch + the inner answer's services
field; the eight named integrated branches are mechanically
classifiable from per-axis branches alone.

Permitted phrasing: *"W41 is the first capsule-native end-to-end
integrated synthesis of the W21..W40 trust-adjudication chain
and the W7..W11 cross-role / multi-round bundle decoder family,
with one manifest-v11 envelope binding both axes plus a cross-
axis witness, and a measured cross-axis branch distribution that
lets researchers distinguish which axis is load-bearing on each
cell."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W41 solves context for multi-agent teams"*,
*"W41 closes W41-L-COMPOSITE-COLLUSION-CAP"*, *"W41 closes
W41-C-NATIVE-LATENT"*, *"W41 gives true 3-host evidence"*, *"W41
makes the repo release-ready by itself"*.

The honest reading is narrower: on R-88-BOTH-AXES, R-88-TRUST-
ONLY-SAFETY, and R-88-INSUFFICIENT-RESPONSE-SIGNATURE, W41
preserves W40 byte-for-byte on the answer field while adding 1
visible token/cell of cross-axis classification overhead and
~15.5k structured bits/cell of cross-axis state under manifest-
v11.  On R-88-COMPOSITE-COLLUSION (the new W41-L-COMPOSITE-
COLLUSION-CAP regime), W41 cannot recover when the adversary
coordinates BOTH the producer-side admission AND the trust-side
W40 ratification on the wrong set; this is the new proved-
conditional limitation theorem.

### "192.168.12.101 is a Mac with a hung Ollama listener" (RETRACTED at W41)

> *"`.101` is a Mac running Ollama with a hung HTTP listener (TCP-up + HTTP-broken)."*

**Retracted at the W41 milestone (2026-05-03).** The W37 / W38 /
W39 / W40 milestones described ``192.168.12.101`` as a third Mac
with a hung Ollama HTTP listener.  Re-probing at the W41
milestone shows that ``.101`` is an **Apple TV / AirPlay
receiver**: ``HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden`` with header ``Server:
AirTunes/860.7.1`` on port 5000; locally-administered MAC
``36:1c:eb:dc:9a:04`` (the second nibble of the first byte is
``6`` => locally administered); no Mac mDNS hostname.  Port
11434 returning "Empty reply from server" is the device closing
the connection on an unrecognised port, NOT a hung Ollama
listener.  No Ollama instance has ever been running on ``.101``
in this network.

The earlier "third physical host candidate" framing was a
network-layer mis-identification.  Recorded as **W41-INFRA-1** in
``docs/RESULTS_COORDPY_W41_INTEGRATED_SYNTHESIS.md §4.1``.  The
honest live multi-host topology going forward is the two-Mac
pair (``localhost`` + ``192.168.12.191``).
``192.168.12.248`` is recorded as gone (per user instruction).

The previous milestone's "two-reachable-host evidence" anchors
remain valid (those used ``localhost`` + ``.191`` directly via
the W39-INFRA-1 fallback path, which correctly avoided ``.101``).

### "Beats" without a baseline

> *"Our decoder beats the priority decoder."*

If you write "beats" or "outperforms", you must name the baseline
and the bench. "Beats" by 5pp on `local_smoke` at $n=80$ is fine;
"beats" without bench is not.

### "Honest" without a referent

> *"The honest reading is..."*

The phrase "honest" is overused. Reserve it for *explicit
contrast* with a named less-honest reading: "The strict reading is
retracted; the honest defensible reading is W3-C9." Do not use
"honest" as a generic intensifier.

### Retroactive scope reduction

> *"The result is at $n=80$."*

If a result was originally claimed at $n=320$ and is now reported
at $n=80$, you must state the retraction explicitly: "Originally
claimed at $n=320$; subsequent measurement at $n=320$ falsified
the strict reading (W3-26)." Silently dropping $n$ is forbidden.

### Asymmetric framing of negative results

> *"The decoder works."*

If a result holds in one direction and not the other, the
statement must reflect both. "Direction-invariant under sign-stable
DeepSet (gap = 0.000) at level 0.237" is permitted.
"DeepSet achieves symmetric zero-shot transfer" is forbidden
(it suggests level-matching, which is false).

### Authority citations without inspection

> *"Theorem W3-37 says…"*

Before you cite a theorem in a new milestone note, verify the
theorem still says what you remember. Theorems can be sharpened
(W3-32 → W3-32-extended), conditional premises can be added or
removed, and conjectures can be promoted or retracted. Always
check `THEOREM_REGISTRY.md` first.

### "W15 shapes transformer attention" or "the salience pack proves attention manipulation"

> *"W15 shapes transformer attention weights so the auditor's
> decoder pays attention to the right evidence."*

Forbidden. The W15 layer uses an *honest proxy* attention metric:
the ``position_of_first_causal_claim`` in the salience-ordered
pack. We do NOT manipulate transformer attention weights; we DO
reorder the bundle so the highest-salience evidence appears at
rank 0, which benefits any downstream LLM consumer via
prompt-position attention (a well-known property of transformer
attention under typical positional encoding regimes). The proxy
metric is auditable; the attention claim is not.

Permitted phrasings: *"W15 places the round-2 specific-tier claim
at rank 0 of the kept bundle in 8/8 R-62-tightbudget cells (the
proxy attention signal)"*, *"the W15 salience pack benefits any
downstream LLM consumer via prompt-position attention shaping under
typical transformer positional encoding regimes"*, *"the
``position_of_first_causal_claim`` metric is the load-bearing
auditable W15 signal"*. Forbidden: *"W15 manipulates attention
weights"*, *"W15 proves attention shaping"*, *"the salience pack is
an attention-mechanism intervention"*. The honest reading is: W15
is a context-packing intervention, not an attention intervention;
the prompt-position attention benefit follows from the packing,
not from any model-internal change.

### "W15 solves multi-agent context" or "the salience pack is universal"

> *"The W15 attention-aware packer solved multi-agent context."*

Forbidden. The honest reading on R-62-tightbudget at n=8 × 5 seeds
is:

* the W15 method achieves ``accuracy_full = 1.000`` on every seed;
* ``capsule_layered_fifo_packed`` (the load-bearing FIFO baseline)
  ties FIFO at ``accuracy_full = 0.000``;
* ``attention_minus_fifo_packed = +1.000`` strict separation
  on every seed.

This is a strong result, but it is **not** "multi-agent context
solved." Permitted phrasings: *"clears bar 12 of the
SDK-v3.16-anchored success criterion"*, *"first decoder-side
context-packing strict gain in the programme"*, *"closes the
W15-Λ-budget gap on R-62-tightbudget under the named bench
property"*. Forbidden: *"solves multi-agent context"*, *"the W15
packer is universal"*, *"W15-1 holds for any decoder budget"*. The
W15-1 win is conditional on (a) the bench property holding, (b)
``T_decoder`` below the union token sum, AND (c) round-2 carrying
a specific-tier disambiguator with no ``service=`` token; if any
of the three is removed, W15-Λ-budget or W15-Λ-degenerate fires
and the result collapses. The W15 layer is *one of seven*
structural axes the programme has identified; "multi-agent context
solved" requires resolving every named limit theorem on every axis,
which the programme has not done.

### "W18 broke the symmetric-corroboration wall" or "we solved ambiguity resolution"

> *"W18 broke the symmetric-corroboration wall."*

Forbidden as a *general* claim. The W18-1 win is *strongly
conditional* on the R-65-COMPAT bench property: round-2
specific-tier disambiguator carries a relational-compound mention
of *every* gold service AND *no* decoy service. Permitted
phrasings: *"clears bar 15 of the SDK-v3.19-anchored success
criterion"*, *"first capsule-native multi-agent-coordination
method that crosses the symmetric-corroboration wall on a regime
where the wall actually applies"*, *"closes the W18-Λ-sym
extension of W17-Λ-symmetric on R-65-COMPAT under the named
bench property"*. Forbidden: *"W18 broke the symmetric wall"*
(unqualified), *"we solved ambiguity resolution"*, *"W18-1 holds
for any decoder bundle"*, *"the relational scorer is universal"*.

The W18-1 win is conditional on:
* (a) symmetric-corroboration round-1 (R-64-SYM bench shape),
* (b) round-2 disambiguator carrying a closed-vocabulary
  relational-compound mention of every gold service AND no decoy
  service (R-65-COMPAT specifically — not R-65-NO-COMPAT,
  -CONFOUND, or -DECEIVE),
* (c) the relational-mention convention being inside the
  closed-vocabulary closure the W18 exact-match scorer reads.

If any condition fails, W18 ties FIFO or fails by construction:
* **W18-Λ-no-compat** (no signal): abstain → tie FIFO at 0.000.
* **W18-Λ-confound** (symmetric signal): abstain → tie FIFO at 0.000.
* **W18-Λ-deceive** (adversarial signal): trust evidence → fail at 0.000.
* **W18-Λ-real** (free-form natural-language mentions outside the
  closure): the closed-form scorer misses by construction.

The W18 method is the *fifteenth* of fifteen named structural
axes the programme has identified; "ambiguity resolution solved"
requires resolving every named limit theorem on every axis,
which the programme has *not* done. The W18-Λ-deceive falsifier
in particular names a structural limit no closed-form scorer
that *trusts* its evidence can escape (the named research move
beyond it is W18-C-OUTSIDE — an outside-information axis to
detect deceptive round-2 mentions, conjectural).

### "W19 broke the deceptive-ambiguity wall" or "we solved adversarial ambiguity"

> *"W19 broke the deceptive-ambiguity wall."*

Forbidden as a *general* claim. The W19-1 win is *strongly
conditional* on the R-66-DECEIVE-NAIVE / R-66-CONFOUND-RESOLVABLE
bench property: the bundle carries at least one *independent
asymmetric witness* — a specific-tier handoff OTHER than the
canonical primary disambiguator whose tokenised payload mentions a
service tag asymmetrically across the candidate set. Permitted
phrasings: *"clears bar 16 of the SDK-v3.20-anchored success
criterion"*, *"first capsule-native multi-agent-coordination
method that resolves bundle-internal contradiction between a
deceptive primary and a witness-corroborated alternative"*,
*"closes the W18-Λ-deceive wall on R-66-DECEIVE-NAIVE under the
named bench property"*. Forbidden: *"W19 solved adversarial
ambiguity"* (unqualified), *"the bundle-contradiction scorer is
universal"*, *"W19-1 holds for any deceptive primary"*, *"the
trust scorer escapes deception in general"*.

The W19-1 win is conditional on:
* (a) symmetric-corroboration round-1 (R-65 / R-66 bench shape),
* (b) the bundle carrying at least one *independent asymmetric
  witness* — i.e. a specific-tier handoff from a non-canonical
  producer role under a synonym kind whose payload mentions a
  service tag asymmetrically (R-66-DECEIVE-NAIVE,
  R-66-CONFOUND-RESOLVABLE, R-66-CORROBORATED — not
  R-66-DECEIVE-TOTAL or R-66-OUTSIDE-REQUIRED),
* (c) the secondary witness's relational-mention convention being
  inside the closed-vocabulary closure the W19 exact-match scorer
  reads (the same closure that bounds W18 / W13 / W12),
* (d) the canonical-role-for-kind table identifying the canonical
  primary correctly — i.e. the primary's
  ``(source_role, claim_kind)`` pair is in
  :data:`_INCIDENT_TRIAGE_CANONICAL_ROLE_FOR_KIND`.

If any condition fails, W19 ties FIFO or fails by construction:
* **W19-Λ-total** (no asymmetric witness anywhere in the bundle):
  W19 reduces to W18 byte-for-byte → primary-trusted branch →
  picks decoy → fails at 0.000.
* **W19-Λ-outside** (witnesses are symmetric across primary's
  named set and the complement): W19 abstains via
  ``W19_BRANCH_ABSTAINED_SYMMETRIC`` → ties FIFO at 0.000.
* **W19-Λ-real** (free-form natural-language witnesses outside the
  closure): the closed-form scorer misses by construction.

The W19 method is the *sixteenth* of sixteen named structural
axes the programme has identified; "adversarial ambiguity solved"
requires resolving every named limit theorem on every axis, which
the programme has *not* done. The W19-Λ-total and W19-Λ-outside
falsifiers in particular name structural limits no closed-form
*bundle-only* scorer can escape (the named research move beyond
both is W19-C-OUTSIDE — an outside-information axis with access
to service-graph topology / prior reliability / cross-incident
historical evidence; conjectural).

### "the W19 trust scorer is a learned model" or "W19 reads attention"

> *"The W19 method uses a small learned trust model that reads
> transformer attention to detect deception."*

Forbidden. The W19 method is a *deterministic, training-free,
closed-form* bundle-contradiction scorer:
* It identifies the canonical primary disambiguator via a closed-
  form sort with a hardcoded canonical-role-for-kind tiebreak
  (:func:`_w19_canonical_primary_index`,
  :data:`_INCIDENT_TRIAGE_CANONICAL_ROLE_FOR_KIND`).
* It counts independent asymmetric witnesses per admitted tag via
  an O(|union| · |tokens| · |admitted_tags|) match loop, excluding
  the primary and deduplicating by
  ``(source_role, claim_kind, payload_sha)``
  (:func:`_w19_witness_counts`).
* It applies a deterministic branch decision: invert when
  ``max_aw(complement) > max_aw(named_set)``; refine when W18
  abstains AND a unique strict-max subset exists; otherwise fall
  through to W18.

There is **no learned model**, no transformer attention reading,
no embedding lookup. A learned variant is the named
**W19-C-LEARNED** conjecture, conjectural and out of scope for
SDK v3.20. Permitted phrasings: *"closed-form bundle-
contradiction scorer"*, *"deterministic training-free trust
scorer"*, *"the W19 scorer counts asymmetric witnesses excluding
the canonical primary"*. Forbidden: *"W19 reads attention
weights"*, *"the W19 trust model"*, *"the W19 learned scorer"*.

### "the relational scorer reads transformer attention" or "W18 is a learned model"

> *"The W18 method uses a small learned compatibility model that
> reads transformer attention to break the symmetric ambiguity."*

Forbidden. The W18 method is a *deterministic, training-free,
closed-form* bundle-relational scorer:
* It tokenises the round-2 disambiguator's payload via a
  closed-form regex-style splitter
  (:func:`_disambiguator_payload_tokens`).
* It scores each admitted service tag via an O(|union| ·
  |tokens|) match loop with contiguous-subsequence semantics for
  compound targets
  (:func:`_relational_compatibility_score`).
* The strict-asymmetric branch fires *iff* at least one but not
  all admitted tags have positive score; otherwise the W18 method
  abstains.

There is **no learned model**, no transformer attention reading,
no embedding lookup. A learned variant is the named
**W18-C-LEARNED** conjecture, conjectural and out of scope for
SDK v3.19. Permitted phrasings: *"closed-form bundle-relational
scorer"*, *"deterministic training-free disambiguator"*, *"the
W18 scorer reads payload bytes via a closed-form tokeniser +
contiguous-subsequence scorer"*. Forbidden: *"W18 reads attention
weights"*, *"the W18 model"*, *"the W18 embedding"*.

### "W16 solves multi-agent context end-to-end" or "the composition is universal"

> *"The W14+W15 composition solved multi-agent context end-to-end."*

Forbidden. The honest reading on R-63-COMPOSED-TIGHT at n=8 × 5
seeds (synthetic) is:

* the composed method (W14 structured prompt + W15 attention-aware
  packer over a magnitude-filter-simulated producer) achieves
  ``accuracy_full = 1.000``;
* every non-composed baseline (W14-only-budgeted, W15-only-without-
  W14, substrate FIFO) ties at ``accuracy_full = 0.000``;
* ``composed - fifo_packed_layered = +1.000`` strict separation on
  every seed.

This is a strong synthetic result, but it is **not** "multi-agent
context solved end-to-end." Permitted phrasings: *"clears bar 13
of the SDK-v3.17-anchored success criterion"*, *"first end-to-end
W14+W15 composition strict gain in the programme"*, *"closes the
W16-Λ-compose gap on R-63-COMPOSED-TIGHT under the named bench
property"*. Forbidden: *"solves multi-agent context end-to-end"*,
*"the W16 composition is universal"*, *"W16-1 holds for any
producer + any decoder budget"*. The W16-1 win is conditional on
(a) the comparable-magnitude multi-hypothesis events, (b) the
structured producer protocol, (c) ``T_decoder`` strictly between
the round-2 disambiguator's token cost and the admitted union's
token sum, AND (d) the asymmetric corroboration shape (decoys ≥ 2
distinct roles, golds = 1 distinct role); if any condition is
removed, W16-Λ-compose / W16-Λ-degenerate / W15-C-SYMMETRIC fires
and the result collapses.

The W14+W15 composition is *one of eight* structural axes the
programme has identified; "multi-agent context solved end-to-end"
requires resolving every named limit theorem on every axis, which
the programme has not done.

### "W16 demonstrates real-LLM transfer is solved" or "the replay path is a real probe"

> *"The W16-Λ-real-replay anchor proves the composition transfers
> to real LLMs."*

Forbidden. The W16-Λ-real-replay anchor is a *measurement* over
**recorded** Phase-61 ``qwen2.5:14b-32k`` bytes — not a fresh live
LLM probe. The Mac-1 endpoint at 192.168.12.191:11434 was offline
(``HTTP=000`` connection refused) at SDK v3.17 milestone capture
time; the Phase-61 capture from SDK v3.15 is the source of truth.

Permitted phrasings: *"the recorded qwen2.5:14b-32k bytes show the
composed method delivers a strict +0.500 gain over FIFO-packed-W14
under T_decoder=14"*, *"the W16-Λ-real-replay anchor confirms the
composition recovers the W14-only loose-budget accuracy under
tight budget pressure on recorded real-LLM bytes"*, *"the budget
band where the gain holds on the recorded stream is T_decoder ∈
[13, 16]"*. Forbidden: *"the composition transfers to a fresh
live LLM"* (untested; W16-C-LIVE-OLLAMA conjectural), *"the replay
result is a real-time win"* (replay is offline replay over
byte-stable JSON), *"W16 closes the model-side judgment gap"* (the
1/8 model-side failure persists on the recorded bytes).

The replay path's contribution is *bounding* the W16 result by the
empirical envelope of the prior milestone's real-LLM probe — it is
honest measurement, not an extrapolation. Treat it the way you
treat the W4-1 lifecycle audit: a tool that surfaces what is true
about the recorded run, not a substitute for a fresh probe.

### "W17 solves multi-agent context" or "the magnitude-hint is universal"

> *"The W17 magnitude-hinted prompt solves the producer-side
> ambiguity-erasure problem."*

Forbidden as stated. The W17 magnitude-hinted prompt closes the
*relative-magnitude* failure mode that the W14 structured prompt
left open on R-61-OLLAMA-A's ``slow_query_archival`` scenario,
producing an 8/8 bench-property hold-rate AND
``capsule_attention_aware = 1.000`` on a fresh live qwen2.5:14b-32k
probe at ``T_decoder = 14``. **But the win is conditional on three
things**: (a) the asymmetric-corroboration bench property
(W17-Λ-symmetric is the named wall when this is absent),
(b) the magnitude-hint table being calibrated to the synthetic
extractor's threshold values (operational definitions, not answer
hints — both gold AND decoy magnitudes are above every threshold),
AND (c) the live endpoint reachable.

Permitted phrasings: *"the W17 magnitude-hinted prompt closes the
1/8 R-61-OLLAMA-A model-side judgment miss"*, *"the magnitude-hint
extension is the load-bearing improvement on the fresh live
probe"*, *"the W17-1 anchor produces +1.000 strict gain over both
substrate FIFO and the FIFO-packed-W14H-only baseline on a fresh
live qwen2.5:14b-32k Mac-1 probe"*. Forbidden: *"W17 solves
multi-agent context"*, *"the magnitude-hint extension makes the
W14 protocol universal"*, *"W17 transfers to every benchmark
family"* (W17-C-CROSS-BENCH is conjectural).

### "W17-Λ-symmetric is just another conjecture"

Forbidden. **W17-Λ-symmetric is a *negative theorem*, not a
conjecture.** It is constructed: every capsule strategy in the
SDK ties FIFO at 0.000 on R-64-SYM under both
``T_decoder ∈ {None, 24}`` by direct measurement on n=8
saturated. The structural argument is the asymmetric-oracle
property of ``services_correct`` set-equality: when the bipartite
``(role × tag, kind, magnitude)`` multiset is symmetric for gold
and decoy, no service-blind admission AND no closed-form salience
packer can prefer one over the other.

Permitted phrasings: *"W17-Λ-symmetric is the first explicit
symmetric-corroboration limit theorem in the programme"*,
*"W17-Λ-symmetric discharges the prior W15-C-SYMMETRIC and
W16-C-SYMMETRIC conjectures as a negative theorem"*,
*"W17-Λ-symmetric names the next research frontier
(W17-C-DISAMBIGUATOR, conjectural)"*. Forbidden: *"the
symmetric-corroboration wall is still open"* (it is closed as a
negative theorem on the closed-form capsule surface; only the
disambiguator escape route is open), *"W17-Λ-symmetric is a
conditional conjecture"* (it is proved-empirical + structural
sketch).

### "The W17-C-XMODEL probe is saturated to 1.000 on 35B"

Forbidden. The R-64-LIVE-XMODEL fresh probe achieves
``capsule_attention_aware = 0.750`` on qwen3.5:35b — bench
property holds in 8/8 (transfer of the magnitude-hint extension
across the 14B → 36B-MoE jump is byte-for-byte on the
bench-property axis), but ``accuracy_root_cause = 0.750`` (the
35B emits a different specific-tier kind on one scenario than
the 14B does). The strict-gain claim against FIFO-pack and
substrate FIFO holds at +0.750 (well above the 0.50 strong-bar
threshold), but the saturated full-correctness clause (1.000 on
35B) is **not** demonstrated.

Permitted phrasings: *"the W17 magnitude-hint extension transfers
to qwen3.5:35b on the bench-property axis"*, *"the strict-gain
claim against substrate FIFO and FIFO-packed-W14H-only holds on
the 35B at +0.750"*, *"the 0.250 gap to 1.000 on 35B is a
model-class-specific specific-tier judgment artifact"*.
Forbidden: *"W17 transfers fully to 35B"*, *"the cross-model
result saturates"*, *"35B closes the gap"* (one specific-tier
judgment artifact remains; W17-C-XMODEL is proved-conditional +
empirical-research, not a saturated full-correctness claim).

### "The W17 magnitude-hint table is answer-leaking"

Forbidden. The :data:`INCIDENT_TRIAGE_DEFAULT_MAGNITUDE_THRESHOLDS`
table values (``LATENCY_SPIKE p95_ms ≥ 1000``,
``ERROR_RATE_SPIKE error_rate ≥ 0.10``,
``FW_BLOCK_SURGE count ≥ 5``) are *operational definitions* —
the same numeric values the synthetic
``MagnitudeFilteringExtractor`` uses (Phase-61 calibration
anchors). They are below *every* gold AND decoy magnitude in
the R-61 / R-64 banks. The magnitude-hint extension does NOT
tell the LLM which service is gold; it removes the LLM's
*relative* magnitude judgment loophole (the failure mode that
produced the slow_query_archival miss).

Permitted phrasings: *"the magnitude-hint table is calibrated to
operational definitions, not to answer hints"*, *"the threshold
values are below every gold and decoy magnitude in the R-61 / R-64
banks"*, *"the W17 extension removes the LLM's relative-magnitude
judgment loophole, not its discrimination ability"*. Forbidden:
*"the magnitude-hint tells the LLM which service is gold"* (it
does not — gold and decoy both exceed every threshold), *"W17 is
prompt-engineering the answer"* (it is enforcing operational
discipline; the synthetic side confirms the same downstream
answer with and without the magnitude-hint, W17-3).

### "W16 makes the W14 or W15 layers obsolete"

Forbidden. W16 is *not* a new mechanism — it is the demonstration
that the existing W14 and W15 layers compose on a single regime
where both are individually load-bearing. On R-63-naive-tight the
composed pipeline ties FIFO at 0.000 (W16-Λ-compose), so neither
layer alone produces the win; on R-63-COMPOSED-TIGHT the
composition ties identical to W14 + W15 stacked. Removing the W14
layer (replacing structured prompt with naive prompt) collapses
the result to 0.000; removing the W15 layer (replacing salience
pack with FIFO pack at the same T_decoder) collapses it to 0.000.

Permitted phrasings: *"W14 + W15 are jointly necessary on R-63"*,
*"the composition recovers correctness when both upstream emission
and downstream retention bottlenecks are present"*, *"W16 is the
coupling statement; it does not subsume the prior layers"*.
Forbidden: *"W16 replaces W14"*, *"W16 makes W15 dispensable"*,
*"the composition is a new mechanism"*. The runtime contract is
unchanged; the SDK ships no new W16 class — the composition is
demonstrated by composing existing ``StructuredProducerProtocol``
+ ``AttentionAwareBundleDecoder`` calls in
``vision_mvp.experiments.phase63_composed_real_llm``.

### "W15 makes the W14 producer protocol obsolete"

Forbidden. W15 is a *decoder-side* intervention; W14 is a
*producer-side* intervention. They compose additively:
W15-C-COMPOSE-W14 conjectures that running W15 over a W14-emitted
stream on R-61-ollama-structured may close the 1/8 model-error
failure that W14 alone leaves, but this is a conjecture not yet
empirically verified. The W15 layer does not refute W14; it adds
an orthogonal axis. On any regime where the producer's emission
stream is the bottleneck (R-61-ollama-naive, R-13-Λ-real), W14 is
load-bearing and W15 has no influence on the producer side.

### "Solved real-LLM transfer" or "the structured prompt closes the W13-Λ-real gap"

> *"The W14 prompt protocol solved real-LLM transfer."*

Forbidden. The honest reading on R-61-ollama-structured at n=8 is:

* the bench property holds in 7/8 scenarios (one model-side
  judgment failure);
* the cross-round capsule pipeline achieves
  ``accuracy_full = 0.500``;
* ``layered − fifo = +0.500`` at *exactly* the R-61-OLLAMA-A
  threshold;
* W13 ties W12 ties W11 because the real LLM emits canonical kinds
  (no drift to widen).

This is a strong real-transfer result, but it is **not** "real-LLM
transfer solved." Permitted phrasings: *"clears the R-61-OLLAMA-A
tier"*, *"first real-LLM strict gain ≥ 0.50 over substrate FIFO in
the programme"*, *"W14 closes the W13-Λ-real producer-side gap on
the redesigned comparable-magnitude events"*. Forbidden: *"solves
real-LLM transfer"*, *"the structured prompt is universal"*,
*"W14-1 holds for any LLM"*. The W14-1 win is conditional on (a)
comparable-magnitude events, (b) structured prompt, (c) the cross-
round capsule pipeline; if any of the three is removed, W14-Λ-prompt
fires and the result collapses to 0.000.

### "W14 makes the W13 normaliser obsolete"

Forbidden. W13's contribution is *structurally invisible* on
R-61-ollama because the real LLM emits canonical kinds (zero drift).
On a *different* model class (e.g. qwen3.5:35b under W14-C4) or
under a *different* prompt, the drift channel may reopen and W13's
closure-widening will be load-bearing again. The W13 layer is
dormant on this regime, not refuted.

### Labelling the runtime "fully capsule-native"

> *"The CoordPy runtime is fully capsule-native."*

Forbidden until sandbox stdout/stderr, parser-internal regex /
recovery state, and on-the-wire LLM streaming chunks are
capsule-tracked. **SDK v3.4 narrows the gap**: PROMPT and
LLM_RESPONSE bytes ARE now capsule-tracked (Theorems W3-42 /
W3-43). The honest current reading is *"capsule-native at the
run boundary, intra-cell pair, parse outcome, and the
prompt/response boundary; not capsule-native at the sandbox
stdio layer or the parser's internal recovery state."*

### Labelling the META_MANIFEST a "signature"

> *"The META_MANIFEST signs the run."*

Forbidden. The META_MANIFEST is a *content-addressed witness*,
not a cryptographic signature. Its claim is that the bytes hash
to the recorded SHA, not that an adversary did not produce them.
Use "witness" or "manifest"; "signature" implies authentication
against an adversary, which we do not provide.

### "Fully reproducible" without scope

> *"CoordPy runs are fully reproducible."*

Forbidden without scope. The accurate statement is:
"Under `RunSpec(deterministic=True)` with a frozen JSONL and a
deterministic-profile sandbox, the **capsule DAG** is reproducible
byte-for-byte (W3-41). Wall-clock fields and host-local paths
are stripped from CIDs; the on-disk product report still records
them for forensic context."

## Required moves

### State the falsifier

Every conjectural claim must name what would falsify it.
"W3-C5: a sub-intra-cell PROMPT capsule slice closes the
inner-loop boundary" is incomplete; "Falsifiers: PROMPT bytes too
large for any reasonable budget; spine CIDs drift under the new
kind" is correct.

### State the scope

Every theorem must name its scope. "W3-32: lifecycle ↔
execution-state correspondence" is incomplete; "on the spine
kinds (PROFILE / READINESS_CHECK / SWEEP_SPEC / SWEEP_CELL /
PROVENANCE / ARTIFACT / RUN_REPORT)" is the full statement.
W3-32-extended explicitly extends to PATCH_PROPOSAL / TEST_VERDICT.

### Cross-link the code

Every theorem must point to its code anchor. The code anchor is
the falsifier of the proof: "the proof says X holds; code Y
implements it; if Y does not implement X, the proof is wrong."

### Mark retractions clearly

When a claim is retracted, do not delete it. Keep it in the
registry with status `retracted` and a one-line explanation of
*why*. Future readers must be able to see what we previously
believed and why we stopped.

### Use the same name for the same claim

If a theorem is referenced in `CAPSULE_FORMALISM.md`,
`THEOREM_REGISTRY.md`, `RESEARCH_STATUS.md`,
`papers/coordpy_capsule_native_runtime.md`, and a milestone note,
the *name and number* must be byte-identical across files.
"Theorem W3-32" never becomes "the lifecycle correspondence
result" without its number.

## How this document is enforced

1. New milestone notes start by reading
   `RESEARCH_STATUS.md` and `THEOREM_REGISTRY.md`. If a
   milestone-note claim contradicts these files, the milestone
   note must update the canonical files (or be sharpened).
2. New paper drafts must reproduce the claim taxonomy table in
   the paper itself, using the same status labels.
3. README / START_HERE must use status labels for any
   theorem-grade claim (or omit the claim).
4. PR review explicitly checks for forbidden phrases ("paradigm
   shift" without reading; "solves" without gate; "fully
   capsule-native"; "signs the run"). PRs that introduce
   forbidden phrases are rejected.

### Labelling the team-coordination layer "solves multi-agent context"

> *"CoordPy solves context for multi-agent teams."*

Forbidden. SDK v3.5 ships *one* capsule-native team-coordination
slice over *one* synthetic benchmark family (Phase-52 incident-
triage) under a deterministic team decoder. The defensible
readings are:

* "On the Phase-52 incident-triage benchmark, the learned
  per-role admission policy (W4-C1) improves pooled team-decision
  accuracy by $+0.097$ full / $+0.156$ root_cause over the
  strongest fixed admission baseline at matched per-role budgets
  (default config, $n_\text{eval}=31$)."
* "Theorem W4-1 mechanically verifies team-lifecycle invariants
  T-1..T-7 on every coordination round. Theorem W4-2 proves
  coverage-implies-correctness conditional on a faithful decoder
  + sound admission. Theorem W4-3 proves a sharp local-view
  limitation: per-role budget below the role's causal-share
  floor cannot be rescued by any admission policy."

The phrase "solves" / "closes" applied to the team-coordination
slice must specify the **gate** (the named theorem and bench);
unqualified is forbidden.

### Labelling W4-C1 as a proven theorem or as a *strict* per-seed advantage

> *"The learned admission policy strictly improves accuracy over
> coverage-guided on every seed."*

Forbidden. The honest reading is the cross-seed table in
`docs/archive/coordpy-milestones/RESULTS_COORDPY_TEAM_COORD.md` § "Cross-seed result":

* The learned policy admits *strictly fewer* handoffs than
  coverage-guided on every train seed (12/12) — this is the
  load-bearing positive empirical signal of W4-C1.
* The learned policy improves pooled `accuracy_full` over
  coverage-guided in 11/12 seeds (mean $+0.054$) and pooled
  `accuracy_root_cause` in 8/12 seeds (mean $+0.032$). The
  advantage is *mean-positive*, not strict per-seed. There is
  one outlier seed where root_cause underperforms by $-0.097$.
* At higher noise (spurious_prob = 0.50), coverage-guided beats
  the learned policy on root_cause (mean $-0.089$).

The accurate phrasings are: "*budget-efficiency dominance is
robust per-seed*"; "*the accuracy advantage is mean-positive on
the default noise config but not strict per-seed*"; "*the
advantage does not survive heavier noise*."

The phrasing "strictly improves" is permitted only on
``mean_n_admitted_auditor`` (handoff-count savings), not on
accuracy. **W4-C1 is a conjecture**, not a theorem.

Single-seed numbers (the historical $+0.097$ full / $+0.156$
root_cause result on one specific seed) may be cited only as
"upper-end single seed" with cross-seed numbers immediately
following. Reporting a single-seed number without the cross-seed
distribution is forbidden.

### Labelling team-level capsules as "production-grade"

> *"CoordPy ships capsule-native multi-agent coordination in production."*

Forbidden. The TEAM_HANDOFF / ROLE_VIEW / TEAM_DECISION capsule
kinds ship in the SDK's closed vocabulary, but the **CoordPy product
runtime** (the ``RunSpec`` → ``RUN_REPORT`` path, ``coordpy-ci``,
``coordpy-capsule verify``) does not seal any of them. They are
emitted only by ``TeamCoordinator`` — the multi-agent coordination
*research slice* (``vision_mvp/coordpy/team_coord.py``). The honest
phrasing is: "SDK v3.5 ships a multi-agent capsule coordination
research slice that runs side-by-side with the CoordPy single-run
runtime; the run-boundary product contract is unchanged."

### Conflating substrate typed handoffs with TEAM_HANDOFF capsules

> *"TypedHandoff and TEAM_HANDOFF are the same thing."*

Forbidden. They are *adjacent* but distinct:

* ``TypedHandoff`` (``vision_mvp.core.role_handoff``) is the
  Phase-31 substrate primitive — a frozen dataclass routed
  through ``HandoffRouter`` / ``RoleInbox``. The capsule layer
  does not see it natively; the ``capsule_from_handoff`` adapter
  produces a HANDOFF capsule (``CapsuleKind.HANDOFF``) from one.
* ``TEAM_HANDOFF`` (``CapsuleKind.TEAM_HANDOFF``,
  ``vision_mvp.coordpy.team_coord``) is born as a capsule and has
  no substrate twin. Identity is content-addressed by the
  capsule's hash, not by a substrate ``handoff_id``.

The two paths can run side by side; they are not interchangeable
at the audit / lifecycle layer.

### Labelling the W7-2 cohort-coherence win as unconditional

> *"Cohort-coherence admission beats FIFO."*

Forbidden without the conditions. The defensible W7-2 reading
names the bench properties that the win depends on:

* **Surplus.** ``|candidates(scenario)| > K_auditor`` — without
  budget pressure, FIFO ≡ admit-all and structure_gain = 0
  identically (W7-1).
* **Foreign-service decoys.** Some auditor-routed candidates carry
  ``service=<tag>`` tokens whose tag differs from the gold
  service. Without this, cohort coherence has no signal to
  exploit.
* **Gold plurality.** The gold service tag has strictly more
  auditor-routed candidates than any decoy service tag. Without
  this, buffered cohort coherence picks the *decoy* plurality and
  ties FIFO at 0.000.
* **Buffered mode.** ``CohortCoherenceAdmissionPolicy(fixed_plurality_tag=...)``
  constructed via ``from_candidate_payloads``. The streaming
  variant (``fixed_plurality_tag=None``) is unstable under arrival
  permutation (W7-1-aux) and ties FIFO on the same bench.

Permitted: "On the Phase-54 default config (K_auditor=4, n_eval=10,
gold-plurality property, foreign-service decoys, surplus on every
scenario), the *buffered* ``CohortCoherenceAdmissionPolicy``
achieves ``accuracy_full = 1.000`` against ``capsule_fifo`` 0.000
— a +1.000 conditional structural win (W7-2)."

Forbidden: "Cohort coherence solves multi-agent context."
Forbidden: "Capsule structure beats FIFO." (Without the bench
conditions named.)

### Conflating Phase-53 and Phase-54 results

> *"SDK v3.8 reverses the SDK v3.7 result."*

Forbidden. The two milestones measure *different bench properties*
and are both true:

* **Phase-53** (SDK v3.7): real-LLM producer extractor;
  ``mean_n_admitted_auditor < K_auditor`` in every regime; FIFO
  ties every fixed strategy at ``accuracy_full = 0.800``;
  capsule layer's contribution is the **lifecycle audit**.
* **Phase-54** (SDK v3.8): deterministic candidate stream with
  cross-role service-tag coherence; gold-plurality property;
  surplus on every scenario; buffered cohort coherence beats
  FIFO by ``+1.000`` on accuracy_full.

Phase-53 is preserved exactly. Phase-54 measures a different slice
that the original bench did not surface. The honest combined
reading is the W7-1/W7-2 dichotomy: **substrate FIFO is unbeatable
under low surplus (W7-1, Phase-53); cohort coherence beats
substrate cleanly under surplus + foreign-service decoys +
gold-plurality (W7-2, Phase-54)**. Both are conditional on stated
bench properties. Neither is universal.

### Labelling the streaming cohort variant as the load-bearing policy

> *"Cohort-coherence admission is the SDK v3.8 win."*

Forbidden without specifying *which* cohort variant. The streaming
variant (``CohortCoherenceAdmissionPolicy()`` with
``fixed_plurality_tag=None``) is unstable under arrival permutation
(W7-1-aux); on the Phase-54 default it ties FIFO at 0.000. The
buffered variant is the load-bearing policy. The honest phrasing:
"The *buffered* ``CohortCoherenceAdmissionPolicy`` (constructed
via ``from_candidate_payloads``) is the SDK v3.8 win."

### Labelling the W12-1 win as unconditional

> *"Robust multi-round bundle decoding solves real-LLM multi-agent
> context."*

Forbidden without the conditions. The defensible W12-1 reading
names the bench properties **and** the closure contract:

* **R-58 delayed-causal-evidence shape.** R-59 inherits the four
  R-58 properties; without them the W11 contradiction-aware drop
  cannot fire even after normalisation.
* **Bounded producer-noise channel.** ``synonym_prob`` and
  ``svc_token_alt_prob`` must be set such that *every* drifted
  ``claim_kind`` is in :data:`CLAIM_KIND_SYNONYMS` and *every*
  drifted ``service=`` token matches a pattern in
  :data:`_SERVICE_TAG_REWRITES`. The closure property is mechanically
  verified by ``NoisyExtractorTests::test_noisy_variants_all_in_synonym_table``.
* **Closed-vocabulary normalisation table fits the benchmark
  family.** The default ``CLAIM_KIND_SYNONYMS`` is fitted to the
  closed-vocabulary incident-triage claim grammar; other benchmark
  families need their own tables.
* **Round-N admission not budget-starved** (inherits W11-4).

Permitted: "On the Phase-59 default config (K_auditor=8,
n_eval=12, ``synonym_prob=0.50, svc_token_alt_prob=0.30``,
synthetic-noisy-LLM extractor; bench property holds 12/12),
``RobustMultiRoundBundleDecoder`` achieves ``accuracy_full = 1.000``
against every un-normalised method including W11
``MultiRoundBundleDecoder`` at 0.000 — a +1.000 strict separation
under the named bounded-noise channel (W12-1)."

Forbidden: "W12 solves real-LLM multi-agent context."
Forbidden: "Robust multi-round bundle decoder beats W11."
(without the bench-shape conditions named).
Forbidden: "Real LLMs satisfy the R-59 bench property out of the
box." (the synthetic noisy extractor is a *calibrated approximation*,
not an empirical real-LLM measurement; the ``ollama`` opt-in mode
is the W12-C2 next data point.)

### Labelling the synthetic-noisy-LLM extractor a "real LLM"

> *"Phase-59 evaluates CoordPy on a real LLM."*

Forbidden without the mode disclosure. The Phase-59 default mode
``synthetic_noisy_llm`` is a *deterministic in-process synthetic
extractor* whose noise channel is calibrated against Phase-53 14B /
35B empirical kind-drift histograms but is *not itself a real LLM
measurement*. The ``ollama`` opt-in mode is the real-LLM path; when
used, the report's ``extractor_stats`` block records
``llm_mode='ollama'``, ``n_real_calls``, ``n_failed_calls``, and
``n_synthetic_fallbacks``. Honest phrasings:

* "Phase-59 default uses a *calibrated synthetic-noisy-LLM
  extractor* whose drift channel mimics Phase-53 14B/35B
  parser_role_response distributions; this is the W12-1 anchor."
* "Phase-59 ``--llm-mode ollama`` is the opt-in real-LLM extension
  path; the W12-C2 conjecture targets that mode."

Forbidden: "Phase-59 measures real-LLM behaviour." (without naming
the LLM mode and the calibration provenance).

### Labelling SDK v3.13 the "synthetic→real-LLM transfer is closed"

> *"SDK v3.13 closes the synthetic→real-LLM transfer gap."*

Forbidden. The honest reading is two-layered:

* SDK v3.13 closes the synthetic→real-LLM transfer gap *under the
  bounded-producer-noise channel* the synthetic noisy extractor
  models. The closure property (every variant the extractor can
  emit is in the normalisation table) is mechanically verified.
* SDK v3.13 does **not** measure transfer to a real Ollama-served
  LLM. The W12-C2 conjecture targets that next move; until it is
  measured (with the ``ollama`` opt-in mode, on Mac 1 or Mac 2),
  the *real* real-LLM transfer reading is open. The synthetic side
  of the bound is the *honest cap* on the SDK v3.13 advance; over-
  claiming is the failure mode this section guards against.

Permitted: "SDK v3.13 closes the synthetic→synthetic-noisy-LLM
transfer gap by adding a closed-vocabulary normalisation layer
ahead of the W11 multi-round bundle decoder; the closure property
on the noise channel is the load-bearing premise; the real-Ollama
transfer (W12-C2) is the next data point."

### Labelling the W13-1 win as unconditional

> *"Layered open-world normalisation solves real-LLM multi-agent
> context."*

Forbidden without the conditions. The defensible W13-1 reading
names the bench properties **and** the closure contract **and** the
honest real-LLM caveat:

* **R-58 delayed-causal-evidence shape.** R-60-wide inherits R-58's
  four properties; without them the W11 contradiction-aware drop
  cannot fire even after layered normalisation.
* **Bounded producer-noise channel inside the heuristic closure.**
  Every variant the wide-OOV extractor emits must be in
  :data:`HEURISTIC_RESCUABLE_OOV_KINDS` AND must match at least one
  pattern in :data:`_HEURISTIC_KIND_RULES`. The closure-membership
  property is mechanically verified by
  ``W13ClosureTests::test_every_wide_oov_variant_outside_w12_inside_w13``.
* **Heuristic abstraction rules fit the benchmark family.** The
  default :data:`_HEURISTIC_KIND_RULES` is fitted to the closed-
  vocabulary incident-triage claim grammar; other benchmark
  families need their own rule sets (W13-C1).
* **Round-N admission not budget-starved** (inherits W11-4).

Permitted: "On the Phase-60 default config (K_auditor=8, n_eval=12,
``synthetic_wide_oov_llm`` extractor at ``wide_oov_prob=0.50``;
bench property holds 12/12 after layered normalisation),
``LayeredRobustMultiRoundBundleDecoder`` achieves
``accuracy_full = 1.000`` against every fixed-vocabulary method
including W12 ``RobustMultiRoundBundleDecoder`` at 0.000 — a
+1.000 strict separation under the named bounded-OOV-in-heuristic-
closure channel (W13-1). On real Ollama 14B (R-60-ollama), the
bench property does not hold and the W13 advance is structurally
invisible — see § 1.4 of the success criterion (R-60-OLLAMA-C
honest negative)."

Forbidden: "W13 solves real-LLM multi-agent context."
Forbidden: "Layered normalisation always beats W12."
(Without the bench-shape + closure-membership conditions named.)
Forbidden: "Real Ollama 14B drifts kinds and W13 rescues the run."
(The empirical observation is the *opposite*: real Ollama 14B
emits canonical kinds at temperature 0; the W13 advance is on
synthetic wide-OOV, not on real-LLM drift.)
Forbidden: "The synthetic→real-LLM transfer is closed."
(R-60-ollama is R-60-OLLAMA-C honest-null; the transfer story has
five layers and the real-LLM gate is event-shape / prompt-side
discipline, not normalisation.)

### Labelling the heuristic abstraction layer "open-world generalisation"

> *"CoordPy now generalises to open-world LLM drift."*

Forbidden without the closure boundary disclosure. The W13-1 result
is *closure widening*, not *closure elimination*:

* The heuristic rule set has a *finite predicate union*. Inputs
  whose surface form witnesses none of the patterns escape the
  closure.
* The W13-4 falsifier (R-60-cosmic) is the named structural limit:
  truly arbitrary OOV (XYZZY_QQQQ, COSMIC_RAY_FLIP, …) ties
  ``LayeredRobustMultiRoundBundleDecoder`` at FIFO 0.000.
* The W13 method *widens* the W12 closure on the kinds the
  benchmark family's heuristic rules cover; it does not generalise
  to arbitrary LLM drift.

Permitted: "W13 widens the W12 fixed-vocabulary closure on the
incident-triage benchmark family by adding a small set of regex-
predicate abstraction rules; the new closure strictly contains the
W12 closure on R-60-wide (proved-empirical) and is bounded above
by the predicate union (W13-4)."

Forbidden: "W13 normalises arbitrary LLM drift."
Forbidden: "W13 generalises to any benchmark family."
(W13-C1 is conjectural for non-incident-triage families.)

### Labelling the R-60-ollama probe a "real-LLM win"

> *"SDK v3.14 wins on real Ollama 14B."*

Forbidden. The honest reading is the four-tier R-60-ollama grading
(§ 1.4 of the success criterion):

* SDK v3.14's R-60-ollama observation lands at **R-60-OLLAMA-C
  (null real transfer; honest negative)**: real Ollama 14B at
  temperature 0 on the calibrated incident-triage prompt does not
  drift kinds AND filters low-magnitude decoy events. The bench
  property holds in 0/4 scenarios; W12 / W13 normalisation has
  nothing to rescue.
* The W13 advance is on R-60-wide synthetic, NOT on R-60-ollama.
* The R-60-ollama probe is a *measurement* anchor; it falsified the
  conjecture (W12-C2) that real Ollama would emit non-trivial
  drift on this prompt. It does NOT falsify the W13 method itself
  on R-60-wide.

Permitted phrasings:

* "SDK v3.14 clears the strong success bar of
  ``docs/SUCCESS_CRITERION_MULTI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`` § 1.1 (R-60
  anchor) on the Phase-60 wide-OOV synthetic regime; the R-60-
  ollama probe lands at the R-60-OLLAMA-C tier (honest null real
  transfer) — the milestone is therefore strong-success on R-60-
  wide AND a partial-success / honest-null on R-60-ollama."
* "Real Ollama 14B at default settings emits canonical kinds and
  filters low-magnitude decoy events; the synthetic→real-LLM
  transfer story is gated by event-shape design + prompt-side
  discipline (W13-Λ-real), not by normalisation. SDK v3.14 measures
  this honestly without overclaiming."

Forbidden: "SDK v3.14 closes synthetic→real-LLM transfer."
Forbidden: "Real Ollama 14B emits drift; W13 rescues it."

### "W22 solves wire-cost" or "the latent digest is a real KV cache"

> *"W22 solves the wire-cost half of multi-agent coordination."*

Forbidden as a *general* claim. The W22-1 win is *strongly
conditional* on the R-69-CACHE-FANOUT bench property: at least
two cells share an OutsideQuery + oracle_id pair (else the cache
cannot hit) AND the inner W21 fires
``W21_BRANCH_QUORUM_RESOLVED`` on every cell (else there is
nothing to compress) AND the controller's verifier schema CID
matches the producer's signed CID. Permitted phrasings: *"clears
the post-W21 efficiency bar of the SDK-v3.23-anchored success
criterion (R-69)"*, *"the first capsule-native multi-agent-
coordination method that combines explicit-capsule passing with
audited proxies for the LatentMAS direction"*, *"closes the
wire-cost half of W21-C-CALIBRATED-TRUST on R-69-CACHE-FANOUT
under the named bench property"*. Forbidden: *"W22 solved the
wire-cost concern"* (unqualified), *"W22 is a KV cache"*, *"W22
implements latent state transfer between LLM agents"*. The W22
``SharedReadCache`` is a CAPSULE-LAYER proxy for the LatentMAS
shared-KV-read direction; it does NOT touch transformer-internal
KV caches, embedding tables, attention weights, or any model-
internal state. The "shared cache" stores raw oracle reply bytes,
content-addressed by the OutsideQuery + oracle_id CID; the cost
metric is wire-side oracle reply tokens not paid because the
entry was already in the cache — measured at the capsule
boundary.

The W22-1 win is conditional on:
* (a) the cache-hit-rate condition (cross-cell OutsideQuery
  overlap),
* (b) the inner W21 trigger condition (``W21_BRANCH_QUORUM_RESOLVED``),
* (c) the verifier-side schema CID match.

If any condition fails, W22 reduces to W21 byte-for-byte or
abstains by construction:
* **W22-Λ-no-cache** (no repeated reads): cache_tokens_saved = 0;
  the digest still compresses but no wire-side savings.
* **R-69-POISONED-DIGEST** (tampered envelope): controller fires
  ``hash_mismatch`` → W22 falls through to W21 baseline.
* **R-69-SCHEMA-DRIFT** (verifier registered with different
  schema CID): controller fires ``schema_cid_mismatch`` →
  fall through.
* **R-69-NO-TRIGGER** (W21 abstained): W22 fires
  ``W22_BRANCH_NO_TRIGGER`` and reduces to W21 byte-for-byte.

The natural extensions are conjectural and must be labelled
that way:
* **W22-C-CACHE-AMPLIFICATION** — when a probabilistic LLM
  oracle is in the registry, the cache freezes the LLM's first
  reply across all matching cells; bad first replies poison many
  cells (observed empirically on mixtral:8x7b live regime, 1/4
  drifts).
* **W22-C-LATENT-KV-NATIVE** — the W22 typed-envelope +
  verification surface as an integration boundary for true
  cross-host KV reuse between MLX-distributed LLM servers (not
  implemented; remains conjectural pending Mac-2 return).

### "We've implemented LatentMAS" or "this is collective KV pooling"

> *"This implements the LatentMAS direction."*

Forbidden as an *unqualified* claim. The W22 family implements
**capsule-layer audited proxies** for *some* of the LatentMAS
idea families:

* **schema-passing** → ``SchemaCapsule`` (closed-vocabulary type
  schema, content-addressed, shared once per session by CID).
* **delta execution** → ``LatentDigestEnvelope`` (one typed
  envelope per cell summarising the W21 vote outcome instead of
  replaying the verbose audit).
* **shared-read cache** → ``SharedReadCache`` +
  ``CachingOracleAdapter`` (CID-keyed write-once-read-many; oracle
  replies cached at the capsule boundary).
* **controller-verified side channel** → ``verify_latent_digest``
  (hash-chained, schema-versioned, parent-CID-sealed; rejection
  on any failure).

These are **honest proxies at the capsule layer**, NOT runtime
KV-cache transplants. Permitted phrasings: *"capsule-layer proxy
for the LatentMAS shared-KV-read direction"*, *"audited
controller-verified compact handoff abstraction"*, *"the closest
honest implementation of the LatentMAS idea family this repo can
verify end-to-end"*. Forbidden: *"we implemented LatentMAS"* (no
runtime KV manipulation), *"collective KV pooling"* (the cache
stores oracle reply bytes, not model-internal KV pairs),
*"latent hidden-state transfer"* (no model state is transferred;
only typed audit summaries).

If a future programme builds true KV-sharing between Apple-Silicon-
distributed MLX servers, the W22 typed-envelope + verification
surface is a useful integration-boundary anchor — but the W22
family as shipped does **not** make that claim.

## Change log

- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.3).** Initial canonical version. Adds
  PARSE_OUTCOME / lifecycle-audit / deterministic-mode rules
  ("not fully capsule-native", "not a signature", "not fully
  reproducible without scope").
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.4).** Sharpens "fully capsule-native" rule
  — PROMPT / LLM_RESPONSE bytes ARE now capsule-tracked
  (W3-42 / W3-43). Adds rule that synthetic-LLM cross-model
  research (W3-C6) must be cited as *synthetic*, not as a
  cross-LLM measurement. New forbidden phrase: "the parser
  failure-kind distribution is stable across LLMs" — the
  empirical claim only covers the calibrated synthetic
  distribution library, not real cross-LLM behaviour.
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.5).** Adds team-coordination rules:
  forbidden phrases "solves multi-agent context" without a
  named theorem-bench gate; W4-C1 cited as a theorem; team-level
  capsule kinds described as production-grade; conflation of
  ``TypedHandoff`` with ``TEAM_HANDOFF``. Adds the canonical
  defensible reading template for the Phase-52 result.
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.8).** Adds W7 rules: forbidden phrases
  "cohort-coherence admission beats FIFO" without the
  bench-property conditions; "SDK v3.8 reverses SDK v3.7" without
  the W7-1/W7-2 dichotomy framing; "cohort-coherence is the
  SDK v3.8 win" without specifying *buffered* (vs streaming)
  variant.
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.9).** Adds W8 rules: forbidden phrases
  "cross-role corroboration beats W7-2" without the
  bench-property conditions; "we solved multi-agent context"
  without naming the **strong success bar** in
  ``docs/SUCCESS_CRITERION_MULTI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`` § 1.1; "the
  three-regime win is universal" without naming the W8-4
  falsifier regime.
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.10).** Adds W9 rules: forbidden phrases
  "multi-service corroboration beats W8" without the
  bench-property conditions (multi-service-gold + both gold
  services 2-role corroborated + single-role decoy storm);
  "we solved multi-agent context" still forbidden after the
  Phase-56 result — it now spans **four** named regimes, not
  all of multi-agent reality; "the four-regime win is universal"
  without naming the W9-4 falsifier regime (decoy-corroborated
  decoy); "W8 was wrong" — W8 is *unchanged* and still wins on
  Phase 55, W9 is a strict generalisation that adds Phase 56,
  not a refutation.
- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.14).** Adds W13 rules: forbidden phrases
  "layered open-world normalisation solves real-LLM multi-agent
  context" without the closure-membership conditions; "CoordPy now
  generalises to open-world LLM drift" without the W13-4 closure
  boundary disclosure; "SDK v3.14 wins on real Ollama 14B" without
  the R-60-OLLAMA-C honest-null tier disclosure; "we solved
  multi-agent context" still forbidden after R-60-wide — the
  strongest cross-regime win now spans **seven** named regimes
  (R-54..R-58 + R-59 noisy + R-60-wide) AND a real-LLM
  *measurement* (R-60-ollama, honest-null), but is conditional on
  bounded drift inside a finite predicate-set closure; "W12 was
  wrong" — W12 is *unchanged* and still wins on R-58 / R-59 /
  R-60-clean / R-60-synonym, W13 is a strict additive widening
  layer that adds R-60-wide, not a refutation.

- **2026-04-26 (SDK v3.13).** Adds W12 rules: forbidden phrases
  "robust multi-round bundle decoding solves real-LLM multi-agent
  context" without the bench-shape + closure-property conditions;
  "Phase-59 evaluates CoordPy on a real LLM" without naming the
  LLM mode (synthetic_noisy_llm vs ollama); "SDK v3.13 closes the
  synthetic→real-LLM transfer gap" without the bounded-producer-

  forbidden after the Phase-59 result — the strongest cross-regime

  AND a real-LLM-shaped stream, but is conditional on the closure
  property and on a synthetic noise channel; "W11 was wrong" —
  W11 is *unchanged* and still wins on R-58 + R-59-clean, W12 is a
  strict additive layer that adds R-59-noisy, not a refutation.

### Labelling the W8-1 win "the W8 multi-service-gold falsifier" (named for SDK v3.10)

> *"On multi-service-gold benches, single-tag corroboration is
> sufficient."*

Forbidden. The **W8 multi-service-gold falsifier** is named in the
v3.10 milestone: when ``gold_services`` has size > 1, the W8 buffered
policy admits only the top-1 corroborated tag and the decoder's
``services`` set is a singleton, so ``services_correct`` fails by
set equality regardless of the corroboration signal's quality. The
SDK v3.10 ``MultiServiceCorroborationAdmissionPolicy`` (W9) was
built specifically to address this falsifier; the SDK v3.10
contract tests
(``Phase56DefaultConfigTests::test_w8_falsifies_on_phase56``) gate
the falsifier mechanically.

The defensible reading: "W8 is sufficient on single-service-gold
benches; W9 is required for multi-service gold."

### Labelling the W9-1 multi-service win as unconditional

> *"Multi-service corroboration beats W8 on multi-agent benchmarks."*

Forbidden without the conditions. The defensible W9-1 reading
names the bench properties:

* **Surplus.** ``|candidates(scenario)| > K_auditor`` — without
  budget pressure, FIFO ≡ admit-all and structure_gain = 0
  identically (W7-1).
* **Multi-service gold.** ``|gold_services| ≥ 2``. On
  single-service-gold benches, W9 collapses to W8 (W9-3) and
  beats nothing W8 doesn't.
* **Both gold services cross-role corroborated.** Each gold
  service has ≥ ``min_corroborated_roles`` distinct producer
  roles. Without this, the gold tag is below the role threshold
  and W9 admits nothing tagged.
* **Single-role decoy storm only.** Every decoy service has
  ≤ 1 distinct producer role. If a decoy is also corroborated by
  ≥ ``min_corroborated_roles`` distinct roles, W9 admits the
  decoy (the W9-4 falsifier).

If any of these fails, the W9-1 win does not necessarily hold.

### Labelling the SDK v3.10 result "we solved multi-agent context"

> *"SDK v3.10 solves multi-agent context."*

Still **forbidden** after the Phase-56 result. The defensible
reading is that SDK v3.10 ships the **second consecutive
strong-bar conditional structural win** (this time on R-56
multi-service gold), the structural win now spans **four** named
regimes (R-53 / R-54 / R-55 / R-56), and is the **first programme
result whose strict-gain regime is not solvable by the previous
SDK's strongest method** — but real multi-agent reality has more
axes than four pre-committed regimes (heterogeneous producers,
time-varying budgets, multi-round handoffs, multi-service
incidents with `|gold| ≥ 3`, decoder-side coordination).

Defensible phrasings:

* "SDK v3.10 clears the strong success bar of
  `docs/SUCCESS_CRITERION_MULTI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` § 1.1 (R-56
  anchor) on the Phase-56 multi-service-gold + cross-role-
  corroborated bench."
* "SDK v3.10 is the first programme result to strictly separate
  multi-service top-K corroboration from single-tag corroboration
  (W9-1 vs W8); the win is conditional on the multi-service-gold
  + single-role-decoy property; the W9-4 falsifier regime is the
  named structural limit."
* "Four regimes anchored, the W9-1 conditional win is sharp; the
  W9-4 falsifier (decoy corroboration) is the next axis to attack
  — by the W9-C1 bundle-aware decoder companion."

### Labelling the W8-1 corroboration win as unconditional

> *"Cross-role corroboration beats W7-2 on multi-agent benchmarks."*

Forbidden without the conditions. The defensible W8-1 reading
names the bench properties:

* **Surplus.** ``|candidates(scenario)| > K_auditor`` — without
  budget pressure, FIFO ≡ admit-all and structure_gain = 0
  identically (W7-1).
* **Decoy raw plurality.** Some decoy service has strictly more
  raw mentions in the auditor stream than gold. Without this,
  W7-2 single-tag plurality also wins, so corroboration only
  matches W7-2 (W8-3 backward-compat — not a strict separation).
* **Cross-role-corroborated gold.** The gold service is mentioned
  by strictly more distinct producer roles than any decoy
  service. Without this, the corroboration policy picks the
  decoy plurality and ties FIFO at 0.000 (W8-4 falsifier).
* **Buffered mode.** ``CrossRoleCorroborationAdmissionPolicy(fixed_dominant_tag=...)``
  constructed via ``from_candidate_stream``. The streaming variant
  is unstable under arrival permutation in the same sense as
  W7-1-aux; do not cite it as the load-bearing variant.

Permitted: "On the Phase-55 default config (K_auditor=4,
n_eval=10, decoy-plurality + cross-role-corroborated-gold property),
the *buffered* ``CrossRoleCorroborationAdmissionPolicy`` achieves
``accuracy_full = 1.000`` against ``capsule_fifo`` 0.000 AND
``capsule_cohort_buffered`` (W7-2) 0.000 — a +1.000 strict
separation from both baselines (W8-1)."

Forbidden: "Cross-role corroboration solves multi-agent context."
Forbidden: "Capsule corroboration always beats W7-2."
Forbidden: "Capsule structure beats FIFO." (Without the bench
conditions named — same as the W7-2 rule.)

### Labelling the streaming corroboration variant as the load-bearing policy

> *"Cross-role corroboration is the SDK v3.9 win."*

Forbidden without specifying *buffered* mode. The streaming
variant (``CrossRoleCorroborationAdmissionPolicy()`` with
``fixed_dominant_tag=None``) is arrival-order-sensitive in the
same way W7-1-aux describes for streaming cohort coherence. The
buffered variant (constructed via ``from_candidate_stream``) is
the load-bearing one and the W8-1 anchor. The honest phrasing:
"The *buffered* ``CrossRoleCorroborationAdmissionPolicy`` is the
SDK v3.9 win."

### Labelling the SDK v3.9 result "we solved multi-agent context"

> *"SDK v3.9 solves multi-agent context."*

Forbidden. SDK v3.9 ships the strongest cross-regime conditional
structural-win the programme has ever produced (Phase 55 strict
gain + Phase 54 backward-compat + Phase 53 no-regression, stable
across 5/5 bank seeds, named falsifier regime correctly ties FIFO).
This clears the **strong success bar** of
``docs/SUCCESS_CRITERION_MULTI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`` § 1.1 — a real
advance, not a null milestone. But "solved" remains forbidden:

* The W8-1 win is *conditional* on the named bench property
  (decoy-plurality + cross-role-corroborated gold). The W8-4
  falsifier regime is the named conditional limit.
* Real production multi-agent teams have additional axes
  (heterogeneous producers, time-varying budgets, multi-round
  handoffs, conflicting goals, multi-service gold answers) that
  Phase 55 does not test. W8-C1 / W8-C2 / W8-C3 are the
  conjectural extensions; none are yet shipped.
* Three named regimes is a stronger cross-regime result than
  two, but it is not "all regimes." Real-LLM under multi-service
  decoy chatter (W8-C2) is the natural next falsifier.

Permitted phrasings:

* "SDK v3.9 clears the strong success bar of
  ``docs/SUCCESS_CRITERION_MULTI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`` § 1.1 on
  three named regimes (no-regression on R-53, backward-compat on
  R-54, strict win on R-55) with cross-bank stability and a named
  falsifier."
* "On the Phase-55 default config (named bench property),
  buffered cross-role corroboration achieves +1.000 accuracy_full
  vs both substrate FIFO and SDK v3.8 W7-2 buffered cohort, the
  first strict separation between cross-role corroboration and
  single-tag plurality cohort in the programme."
* "Three regimes anchored, the W8-1 conditional win is sharp
  and falsifiable. We have not solved multi-agent context;
  we have made the strongest cross-regime conditional advance
  to date."

### Conflating Phase-54 and Phase-55 results

> *"SDK v3.9 reverses the SDK v3.8 result."*

Forbidden. The two milestones measure *different bench properties*
and both are true:

* **Phase-54** (SDK v3.8): deterministic candidate stream with
  cross-role service-tag coherence; **gold raw plurality**
  property; surplus on every scenario; buffered cohort coherence
  beats FIFO by +1.000 on accuracy_full.
* **Phase-55** (SDK v3.9): deterministic candidate stream with
  cross-role corroboration; **decoy raw plurality** + **gold
  cross-role corroboration** property (strict separation from
  Phase 54); surplus on every scenario; buffered cross-role
  corroboration beats both FIFO AND W7-2 by +1.000 on
  accuracy_full.

W7-2 on Phase 54 is preserved exactly. Corroboration on Phase 54
matches W7-2 (W8-3 backward-compat). The honest combined reading
is the W7-2 / W8-1 strict-generalisation hierarchy: **W7-2 wins
on gold-plurality benches; W8-1 wins on the strict superset
that includes decoy-plurality with cross-role-corroborated gold;
W8-3 backward-compat preserves W7-2's wins under W8.**

### Conflating Phase-53 and Phase-55 results

> *"Phase 55 makes Phase 53 obsolete."*

Forbidden. Phase 53 is the **real-LLM low-surplus** anchor for
W7-1 (FIFO unbeatability under low surplus). Phase 55 is the
**deterministic budget-pressured + decoy-plurality + gold-
corroborated** anchor for W8-1. They measure orthogonal axes:

* Phase 53 tests *real-LLM extractor variability* with a small
  candidate stream (low surplus → no admission policy can win).
* Phase 55 tests *cross-role admission decision quality* with a
  designed candidate stream where admission *can* win.

Both are true; both are conditional. The W8-1 win on Phase 55
**does not contradict** the W7-1 result on Phase 53 — they
operate in disjoint regimes (high surplus vs low surplus).

### W23 forbidden moves

#### "W23 implements cross-cell KV sharing" or "the session digest is a real shared KV cache"

> *"W23 implements cross-cell KV sharing between LLM agents."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The W23
``SessionDigestEnvelope`` is a hash-chained capsule-layer summary;
it does **not** touch transformer-internal KV caches,
embedding tables, attention weights, or any model-internal state.
The "cross-cell state" is a SHA-256-addressed, schema-versioned,
parent-CID-sealed running summary of W21/W22 vote outcomes — a
controller-side audit object, not a runtime KV transplant.

Permitted phrasings: *"capsule-layer proxy for the LatentMAS
*cross-cell latent state-sharing* direction"*, *"the smallest
honest cross-cell state-sharing mechanism this repo can validate
end-to-end"*, *"clears the post-W22 efficiency bar of the SDK-
v3.24-anchored success criterion (R-70)"*, *"the first capsule-
native multi-agent-coordination method that combines explicit-
capsule passing with audited proxies for the LatentMAS direction
at the **cross-cell** session layer"*. Forbidden: *"W23 implements
cross-cell KV sharing"*, *"W23 is a real shared KV cache between
agents"*, *"the session digest is a hidden-state transfer"*.

#### "the super-token IS embedding-level steganography" or "W23 implements super-token side channels"

> *"W23 implements the LatentMAS super-token side channel."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The
``SuperTokenReferenceEnvelope`` is a single-visible-token CID
prefix verified through a controller-side
``SuperTokenRegistry`` — at most one whitespace token per cell;
at most ``hex_prefix_len`` (default 16) characters of payload;
the registry is enumerable / auditable; tampering yields a
``hash_mismatch`` or ``unknown_super_token`` rejection. **No
embedding-level intervention happens. No transformer-internal
state is modified.**

Permitted phrasings: *"a bounded, audited proxy for the LatentMAS
*super-token side channel* idea"*, *"single-visible-token CID-
prefix reference verified through a controller-side registry"*,
*"the smallest honest dense-control-payload experiment this repo
can validate end-to-end"*. Forbidden: *"W23 implements
embedding-level steganography"*, *"the super-token bypasses the
explicit context channel"*, *"W23 is a covert channel"*. The
super-token is **not covert**: every reference is registered, the
registry is enumerable, and the verifier rejects unknown tokens.

#### "W23 mitigates probabilistic LLM oracles" or "we've solved cache amplification"

> *"W23 mitigates probabilistic LLM oracles."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The W23-2 mitigation
(``QuorumKeyedSharedReadCache`` with
``CACHE_FRESHNESS_PER_CELL_NONCE`` on the flipping oracle)
strictly improves over W22 baseline by **+0.125** on the
**synthetic** R-70-AMPLIFIED-LLM regime — where the
``FlippingProbabilisticOracle`` deterministically returns a
decoy-asymmetric reply on consult #1 and gold-asymmetric replies
afterwards. On the **live** mixtral 8x7b probe at n=4, the same
mitigation does NOT strictly improve overall accuracy (all four
strategies tie at ``acc_full = 0.750``) — the live LLM's drift
pattern is approximately symmetric across cells at that n.

Permitted phrasings: *"empirically discharges
W22-C-CACHE-AMPLIFICATION as mitigable on the synthetic regime
at +0.125 strict gain"*, *"the W23 quorum-keyed cache changes
half of cells' outcomes on live mixtral n=4 but the mitigation
advantage is not strict per-probe at this n
(W23-C-MITIGATION-LIVE-VARIANCE)"*, *"the synthetic mitigation
preserves cross-cell wire savings on deterministic oracles while
mitigating amplification on probabilistic ones"*. Forbidden:
*"W23 solves cache amplification"*, *"the quorum-keyed cache
mitigates any LLM probabilism"*, *"W23-2 transfers to live LLMs
at n=4"*.

The W23-2 win is conditional on:
* (a) at least one registered oracle's drift pattern follows the
  flipping (first-sample-decoy → later-sample-gold) shape;
* (b) the bench has ≥ 2 cells sharing identical OutsideQuery +
  oracle_id pairs;
* (c) the per-cell nonce successfully fragments the cache key.

The synthetic flipping oracle satisfies (a) by construction; live
LLMs may or may not — the live-LLM transfer is empirical-research,
not strict-empirical.

#### "the cross-host proxy validates two-host execution"

> *"The CrossHostProducerDecoderProxy validates two-host execution."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The
``CrossHostProducerDecoderProxy`` is a **within-process**
JSON-canonical serialisation round-trip; it forces the producer
and decoder to communicate ONLY through canonical bytes (no
shared Python references) so any latent shared state would
surface as a serialisation failure. This validates the
**wire-encoding contract** — bytes round-trip cleanly, the
W23 envelopes survive serialisation, the producer/decoder
interface respects the JSON-canonical encoding boundary.

It does NOT validate:
* socket-level latency, partition tolerance, or RTT contributions
  to the visible-tokens-to-decider metric;
* true two-host execution between Mac 1 and Mac 2;
* network-level adversarial conditions (dropped messages,
  out-of-order delivery, byzantine tampering on the wire).

Mac 2 has been ARP-incomplete for 17 milestones in a row. **No
true two-host execution happened in SDK v3.24.** When Mac 2
returns the same proxy interface drops in over a real socket
with no W23 code changes — but until that happens, every
"cross-host" claim must be qualified as *within-process
structural simulation*, not *cross-host execution*.

Permitted phrasings: *"within-process producer/decoder
host-split simulation"*, *"the wire-format contract is mechanically
validated by JSON-canonical round-trip on every cell"*, *"the
honest fallback for the unreachable Mac 2"*, *"the W23 envelopes
are wire-compatible with cross-host deployment when Mac 2 returns,
no W23 code changes required"*. Forbidden: *"W23 implements
cross-host KV sharing"*, *"the proxy validates two-host
execution"*, *"W23 runs on two Macs"*.

#### Labelling the SDK v3.24 result "we solved multi-agent context"

> *"SDK v3.24 solves multi-agent context."*

Forbidden. SDK v3.24 ships three honest cross-cell-axis advances
(efficiency, cache-amplification mitigation, dense-control side
channel) and the first empirical demonstration in the programme
that a named conjecture's weakness is mitigable. This clears the
post-W22 efficiency bar at +6.67 % to +25.45 % savings AND the
W22-C-CACHE-AMPLIFICATION mitigation bar at +0.125 strict gain
on the synthetic regime. But "solved" remains forbidden:

* The W23-1 win is *strongly conditional* on cross-cell session
  continuity (W23-Λ-no-delta is the named limit).
* The W23-2 mitigation does not strictly transfer to live LLMs at
  n=4 (W23-C-MITIGATION-LIVE-VARIANCE conjectural).
* The W23-3 trust boundary holds on the falsifiers tested but
  does not extend to embedding-level steganography or
  cryptographically-signed envelopes (out of scope).
* Mac 2 is unreachable; no true two-host execution validated.

Permitted phrasings:
* "SDK v3.24 clears the post-W22 cross-cell efficiency bar at
  +6.67 % (delta) to +25.45 % (super-token) on R-70-DELTA-FANOUT
  with chain-verified correctness ratification."
* "On R-70-AMPLIFIED-LLM, the W23 quorum-keyed cache empirically
  discharges W22-C-CACHE-AMPLIFICATION as mitigable at +0.125
  strict gain — the first empirical demonstration in the
  programme that a named conjecture's weakness is mitigable."
* "Three regimes anchored, the W23 conditional advance is sharp
  and falsifiable. We have not solved multi-agent context;
  we have made the strongest cross-regime conditional advance
  on the cross-cell axis to date."

### W24 forbidden moves

#### "W24 implements bounded-context summarisation in the LLM" or "the compact envelope is a real LLM context window manager"

> *"W24 implements bounded-context summarisation inside the LLM."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The W24
``SessionCompactEnvelope`` is a hash-chained capsule-layer summary;
the visible-token cost on the wire collapses to a single
``<compact_ref:DDDD>`` token per cell that the controller resolves
through its own state. **Nothing inside the LLM changes** — no
attention head is reshaped, no KV cache is folded, no model
state is truncated. The "bounded window" lives at the **capsule
layer**.

Permitted phrasings: *"capsule-layer bounded-window summary
proxy for the LatentMAS *running summary* direction"*, *"a
fixed-size envelope that folds the last (compact_window - 1)
prior cell digests into one CID + bounded text"*, *"the smallest
honest bounded-context-summary mechanism this repo can validate
end-to-end"*. Forbidden: *"W24 manages the LLM context
window"*, *"the compact envelope is a real bounded summary inside
the model"*, *"W24 proves bounded context"*.

#### "W24 implements intra-cell self-consistency in the LLM" or "the resample-quorum is a real test-time mixture"

> *"W24 implements intra-cell self-consistency inside the LLM."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The W24
``ResampleQuorumCachingOracleAdapter`` consults the wrapped oracle
``sample_count`` times *at the protocol layer* and returns the
majority verdict. **No change to the LLM's decoding strategy or
sampling temperature happens.** The "resample" is a closed-form
controller-side aggregation of M independent oracle consults,
not an in-model intervention.

Permitted phrasings: *"capsule-layer intra-cell resample-quorum
mitigation"*, *"M-sample majority-vote on the wrapped oracle"*,
*"closed-form policy on the oracle adapter"*. Forbidden: *"W24
implements self-consistency decoding"*, *"the W24 method is a
test-time mixture-of-samples on the LLM"*, *"W24 changes the LLM's
sampler"*.

#### "W24 mitigates probabilistic LLMs in general" or "we've solved live LLM variance"

> *"W24 mitigates live LLM probabilism."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The W24-2 mitigation
strictly improves over W23 PER_CELL_NONCE by **+0.500** on the
**synthetic** R-71-INTRA-CELL-FLIP regime (where the
``IntraCellFlippingOracle`` deterministically returns
decoy-asymmetric on consult #1 and gold-asymmetric on #2..M
within each cell, in isolation as the only registered oracle). On
the **live** mixtral 8x7b probe at n=4, the same mitigation
strictly improves over W23 PER_CELL_NONCE by **+0.250** — the
live LLM does not perfectly match the synthetic pattern.

Permitted phrasings: *"empirically discharges
W23-C-MITIGATION-LIVE-VARIANCE on the intra-cell drift axis at
+0.500 strict gain (synthetic) / +0.250 strict gain (live mixtral
n=4)"*, *"the W24 resample-quorum is bounded by the LLM's
intra-cell drift pattern's similarity to the synthetic
oracle"*, *"the live mitigation is non-trivially measurable but
not saturated at the synthetic rate"*. Forbidden: *"W24 solves
live LLM variance"*, *"the resample-quorum mitigates any LLM
probabilism"*, *"W24-2 transfers fully to live LLMs"*.

The W24-2 win is conditional on:
* (a) at least one consult per cell follows a non-uniform drift
  pattern (i.e. some samples are reliably bad, others reliably
  good);
* (b) the inner oracle's behaviour is sample-count-sensitive (M
  consults yield distinguishable replies);
* (c) the cache-key freshness policy permits resampling within
  one cell without short-circuiting on cache hit.

The synthetic IntraCellFlippingOracle satisfies (a) and (b) by
construction; (c) is satisfied by the per-cell fresh oracle/
cache instances on the bench. Live LLMs at temperature=0 may or
may not satisfy (a) — the live-LLM transfer is
empirical-research, not strict-empirical.

#### "the cross-process wire validates two-host execution"

> *"The CrossProcessProducerDecoderWire validates two-host execution."*

Forbidden as an unqualified claim. The
``CrossProcessProducerDecoderWire`` is a **real
cross-PROCESS** JSON-canonical pipe (Python subprocess + stdin/
stdout); it forces the producer and decoder to communicate ONLY
through OS-level pipes (no shared Python references) so any
latent shared state would surface as a serialisation failure or
an empty subprocess reply. This is **strictly stronger** than
the W23 within-process round-trip — bytes traverse a real OS
pipe, the subprocess can be killed mid-session, and the wire
reports a real failure (not a Python exception in the same
process).

It does NOT validate:
* network-level latency, partition tolerance, or RTT contributions
  to the visible-tokens-to-decider metric across two machines;
* true two-host execution between Mac 1 and Mac 2;
* network-level adversarial conditions (dropped messages,
  out-of-order delivery, byzantine tampering on a real network).

Mac 2 has been ARP-incomplete for 18 milestones in a row. **No
true two-host execution happened in SDK v3.25.** When Mac 2
returns the same JSON-canonical interface drops in over a real
socket with no W24 code changes — but until that happens, every
"cross-host" claim must be qualified as *cross-PROCESS* (real OS
pipe), not *cross-HOST* (real network socket between machines).

Permitted phrasings: *"real cross-process producer/decoder wire
via Python subprocess + stdin/stdout pipes"*, *"the wire-format
contract is validated end-to-end by real OS-level
serialisation/deserialisation"*, *"strictly stronger
cross-process honesty than the W23 within-process round-trip"*,
*"the strongest cross-process honesty this repo can validate
end-to-end on Mac-1 alone"*. Forbidden: *"W24 implements
cross-host KV sharing"*, *"the wire validates two-host
execution"*, *"W24 runs on two Macs"*.

#### Labelling the SDK v3.25 result "we solved multi-agent context"

> *"SDK v3.25 solves multi-agent context."*

Forbidden. SDK v3.25 ships three honest cross-cell-axis advances
(bounded-window efficiency, intra-cell mitigation, real
cross-process honesty) and the first programme-internal
demonstration that the live-LLM mitigation transfer is
non-trivially measurable on a fresh probe. This clears the
post-W23 efficiency bar at +18 % to +20 % savings AND the
W23-C-MITIGATION-LIVE-VARIANCE mitigation bar at +0.500 synthetic
/ +0.250 live strict gain. But "solved" remains forbidden:

* The W24-1 win is *strongly conditional* on cross-cell session
  continuity ≥ ``compact_window`` (W24-Λ-no-compact is the named
  limit).
* The W24-2 mitigation transfers partially to live mixtral
  (+0.250 not +0.500); a live LLM whose intra-cell drift is
  unbiased symmetric across samples would produce
  ``E[mitigation] = 0`` (W24-C-LIVE-VARIANCE-COMPLETE
  conjectural).
* The W24-3 trust boundary holds on the falsifiers tested but
  does not extend to network-level adversarial conditions or
  cryptographically-signed envelopes (out of scope).
* Mac 2 is unreachable; no true two-host execution validated.

Permitted phrasings:
* "SDK v3.25 clears the post-W23 bounded-window efficiency bar
  at +18.0 % (loose) / +20.5 % (tight) on R-71-LONG-SESSION
  with compact-verified correctness ratification."
* "On R-71-INTRA-CELL-FLIP, the W24 resample-quorum empirically
  discharges W23-C-MITIGATION-LIVE-VARIANCE on the intra-cell
  drift axis at +0.500 strict gain on synthetic AND +0.250
  strict gain on live mixtral n=4 — the first programme-internal
  demonstration that the live-LLM mitigation transfer is
  non-trivially measurable on a fresh probe."
* "Three regimes anchored, the W24 conditional advance is sharp
  and falsifiable. We have not solved multi-agent context;
  we have made the strongest cross-regime conditional advance
  on the bounded-window-efficiency + intra-cell-mitigation +
  real-cross-process axes to date."

## SDK v3.30 / W29 — geometry / Grassmannian / factoradic / Lehmer / mixed-curvature / causal-validity vocabulary

W29 introduces new vocabulary that *sounds* model-internal: "geometry
partition", "subspace basis", "Grassmannian-style", "factoradic
routing", "Lehmer code", "mixed-curvature compartments", "causal-
validity gate". Each of these is a **capsule-layer audited proxy**.
None of them claim transformer-internal machinery.

What you may say (W29 honest scope):

* "On R-76-XHOST-DRIFT, the W29 geometry-partitioning step routes
  cells to per-partition inner W28 stacks with structurally
  different oracle topologies; the partition_id is a deterministic
  3-state label (LINEAR / HIERARCHICAL / CYCLIC) computed from the
  W27 input signature CID and a bounded signature history."
* "On R-76-XHOST-DRIFT, the W29 layer **strictly improves
  correctness** over both W27 and W28 baselines: 0.500 → 0.750,
  Δ = +0.250 across 5/5 seeds, with bounded overhead (mean 0.75
  tokens/cell, max 1 token/cell) and trust precision 1.000."
* "The W29 envelope's audited orthonormal subspace basis is a
  **Grassmannian-style proxy at the capsule layer** — every basis
  vector is a deterministic projection over the closed-vocabulary
  tag space; the verifier checks orthogonality (Gram off-diagonal
  ≤ 1e-4), dimension, finiteness, and content-address."
* "The W29 envelope's factoradic Lehmer-code routing index is
  bounded ``0 ≤ idx < K!`` and audit-friendly; the verifier
  decodes the index and checks it matches the registered
  consumer-permutation for the partition."
* "The W29 envelope's causal-validity signature is SHA-256 over
  (parent W28 ratification CID || sorted predecessor CIDs); it is
  a **structural commitment** the bus enforces at admission, NOT
  a temporal-ordering proof at the model layer."
* "On R-76-CROSS-HOST-LIVE the same +0.250 correctness gain holds
  on the live two-host LLM topology; 16 cross-host probe calls;
  710 LAN bytes; trust precision 1.000."
* "W29 empirically discharges W28-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE on the
  magnitude axis — the first synthetic regime in the programme
  where the synthesis (W21 × W27 × W28 × W29) strictly improves
  correctness over the prior best baseline."

What you must NOT say (W29 honest scope):

* "W29 implements transformer-internal subspace projection." It
  does not. The subspace lives at the capsule layer; it is an
  audited proxy.
* "W29 implements Riemannian mixed-curvature manifolds." It does
  not. The "geometry partition" is a structural label
  (linear / hierarchical / cyclic). Mixed-curvature is invoked as
  *design metaphor only* in the module docstring.
* "W29 implements a learned manifold." It does not. Both the
  basis (``compute_structural_subspace_basis``) and the partition
  classifier (``classify_partition_id_for_cell``) are pure
  deterministic functions.
* "W29 solves transformer-internal cross-host KV sharing." It
  does not. The cross-host variance witness records LLM-probe
  disagreement on a content-addressed envelope; it does NOT share
  hidden states across hosts.
* "W29 amplifies cram-factor 8× over W28." Measured ratio on
  R-76-CHAIN-SHARED is 2.30× — the pre-committed H7 ≥ 8× bar was
  MISSED. Mechanism is real; magnitude is below bar; becomes
  named open conjecture **W29-C-CRAM-AMPLIFICATION**.
* "W29 hits 0.95 absolute correctness on R-76-XHOST-DRIFT."
  Measured 0.750 — the pre-committed H6 absolute bar was missed.
  The LOAD-BEARING Δ ≥ 0.10 axis IS met cleanly (Δ = +0.250).
* "W29 brings up Mac 2." It does not. 192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (24th milestone in a row).

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-76-XHOST-DRIFT (the first synthetic regime in the programme
  where W27 alone makes correctness mistakes), W29's geometry-
  partitioning + per-partition inner W28 dispatch strictly improves
  correctness over both W27 and W28 baselines by Δ = +0.250 across
  5/5 seeds at trust precision 1.000, on real LLM bytes too. We
  have not solved multi-agent context; we have empirically
  discharged the named open conjecture
  **W28-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE** on the magnitude axis, on a regime
  where the synthesis (old explicit-capsule trust line × new
  dense-control line) is the load-bearing reason correctness
  improves. The next true wall — whichever regime makes the
  structural classifier's three-way split insufficient to
  discriminate hard cells — is the named open frontier
  **W29-C-NATIVE-LATENT** (architecture-dependent: true
  transformer-internal subspace projection vs the W29 audited
  proxy)."


## SDK v3.31 / W30 — calibrated geometry-aware dense control + multi-stride basis history + per-partition calibration prior + cross-host disagreement-routing + ancestor-chain causal binding

W30 introduces new vocabulary that *sounds* learned or model-internal:
"calibration prior", "running-mean update", "multi-stride history",
"disagreement-routing", "ancestor-chain causal binding".  Each of
these is a **capsule-layer audited proxy**.  None of them claim a
learned model, transformer-internal manipulation, or temporal-
ordering proofs at the model layer.

What you may say (W30 honest scope):

* "On R-77-CHAIN-CRAM, the W30 multi-stride basis-history
  accumulator amplifies cram-factor by 8.74× over W28 AND 3.80×
  over W29 across 5/5 seeds at stride=28, window=12 — the smallest
  stride that achieves the W29 H7 8× bar that W29 itself missed at
  2.30×.  This is the W29-C-CRAM-AMPLIFICATION empirical discharge
  on the magnitude axis."
* "On R-77-CALIBRATION-PRIOR, the W30 per-partition calibration
  prior strictly improves correctness over W29 by Δ = +0.250
  across 5/5 seeds at trust precision 1.000.  The calibrated priors
  (0.95, 0.95, 0.30) reroute CYCLIC cells (low historical
  agreement) to LINEAR (high agreement, full oracle).  This is the
  W29-C-PARTITION-CALIBRATION empirical discharge AND a sharpening
  of W21-C-CALIBRATED-TRUST."
* "On R-77-XHOST-DISAGREE, the W30 cross-host disagreement-routing
  reroutes cells with witnessed disagreement to the high-trust
  partition; Δ = +0.250 across 5/5 seeds.  This sharpens
  W29-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE on the synthetic axis."
* "The W30 envelope's calibration vector is a vector of floats in
  [0, 1] registered at construction time; the running-mean update
  is closed-form arithmetic over observed agreement-rate samples.
  Not a learned model."
* "The W30 envelope's basis history is a content-addressed CID over
  the last K cells' W29 basis CIDs; the verifier checks every CID
  is in the registered set AND the history_cid recomputes byte-
  for-byte."
* "The W30 envelope's ancestor chain is a sorted tuple of registered
  W29 partition CIDs over the last ancestor_window cells; the chain
  CID is SHA-256 over canonical bytes; the controller's bus
  enforces structural commitment to the declared ancestor set at
  admission time."
* "W30 discharges W29-C-CRAM-AMPLIFICATION AND W29-C-PARTITION-
  CALIBRATION in one milestone.  The next true wall is
  W29-C-NATIVE-LATENT (architecture-dependent)."

What you must NOT say (W30 honest scope):

* "W30 implements a learned trust model."  It does not.  The
  calibration vector is registered at construction time; the
  running-mean update is closed-form (``new = (prev * n + obs) /
  (n + 1)``).  A learned variant is the named conjecture
  **W30-C-PRIOR-LEARNING** (open).
* "W30 implements transformer-internal subspace projection."  It
  does not.  The basis history is a capsule-layer accumulator over
  W29's deterministic basis CIDs; an honest **proxy** for the
  LatentMAS shared-substrate direction, not a runtime KV
  transplant.
* "W30 proves temporal ordering at the model layer."  It does not.
  The ancestor chain is a sorted tuple of CIDs sealed by SHA-256;
  it commits the bus to the declared ancestor set, not to a
  particular execution sequence at the model layer.
* "W30 solves cross-host disagreement reduction."  Not in general.
  The H8 strict gain is on **synthetic** disagreement (constructed
  via a deterministic ``_SyntheticDisagreementProbe``); the
  live-LLM extension to a regime where two reachable LLMs
  systematically disagree at temperature 0 remains the named open
  **W30-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE**.
* "W30 amplifies cram-factor 8× on every regime."  It amplifies at
  the *registered* stride and ancestor_window; the linear scaling
  with stride is honest mechanism, but the magnitude depends on
  the bench parameters.  The H6 bar specifies the smallest stride
  at which the 8× ratio holds.
* "W30 brings up Mac 2."  It does not.  192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (25th milestone).
* "W30 closes W29-C-NATIVE-LATENT."  It does not.  W30 is a
  capsule-layer mechanism extension; the architecture-dependent
  native-latent question is still open.
* "W30 solves multi-agent context."  Three named conjectures
  discharged + one sharpened in one milestone is a strong step,
  but real multi-agent reality has more axes than any 5-seed
  synthetic bench can test.

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-77-CHAIN-CRAM, R-77-CALIBRATION-PRIOR, and R-77-XHOST-
  DISAGREE (three pre-committed regimes), the W30 calibrated
  geometry-aware dense control mechanism simultaneously discharges
  W29-C-CRAM-AMPLIFICATION (cram_ratio_w30/w28 = 8.74×, cram_ratio
  w30/w29 = 3.80×, both across 5/5 seeds) AND W29-C-PARTITION-
  CALIBRATION (Δ correctness = +0.250 across 5/5 seeds, trust
  precision 1.000) AND sharpens W29-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-
  MAGNITUDE on the synthetic axis (Δ correctness = +0.250 across
  5/5 seeds). We have not solved multi-agent context; we have
  empirically discharged three named open conjectures in a single
  milestone, on a regime where the synthesis (W29 geometry-
  partitioning + W30 calibration + multi-stride history +
  disagreement-routing + ancestor chain) is the load-bearing reason
  correctness AND structured-bits-per-token AND trust precision all
  improve simultaneously.  The next true wall — the regime where
  the audited capsule-layer proxy is insufficient and real
  transformer-internal subspace projection is required — is the
  named open frontier **W30-C-NATIVE-LATENT**."

### W31 forbidden moves

W31 introduces another wave of vocabulary that *sounds* learned or
model-internal: "online learning", "running-mean update inside the
orchestrator", "adaptive threshold", "sealed prior trajectory",
"manifest CID".  Each of these is a **capsule-layer audited proxy**.
None of them claim a learned model in the deep-learning sense (zero
parameters, zero gradients, zero training step), transformer-
internal manipulation, or temporal-ordering proofs at the model
layer.

What you may say (W31 honest scope):

* "On R-78-NONSTATIONARY-PRIOR, the W31 closed-form running-mean
  update inside the orchestrator drives the per-partition
  calibration prior down on observed CYCLIC failures and the
  clipped-median adaptive threshold (0.8) makes the W30 reroute
  fire — strictly improving correctness over the W30 uniform-priors
  baseline by Δ = +0.125 across 5/5 seeds at trust precision 1.000.
  This is the W30-C-PRIOR-LEARNING empirical discharge on the
  magnitude axis."
* "On R-78-ADAPTIVE-THRESHOLD vs R-78-FROZEN-THRESHOLD, the
  adaptive axis isolates: with the same online-learned prior,
  clipped-median adaptive threshold yields Δ = +0.125 vs Δ = 0 for
  frozen 0.5 threshold; the difference (+0.125 ≥ +0.05) attributes
  the gain to the adaptive contribution."
* "On R-78-MANIFEST-TAMPER, the W31 manifest CID + cross-cell
  ``registered_prior_trajectory_cid`` check together detect five
  named tampers per cell-position; rejection rate = 1.000 across
  65 named tampers including the cross-cell trajectory swap that
  self-consistently recomputes the manifest CID."
* "On R-78-XLLM-LIVE, gemma2:9b on localhost vs qwen2.5:14b on
  192.168.12.191 disagree on 2/8 = 0.250 of structured-decision
  prompts at temperature 0, reproducible byte-for-byte across two
  runs.  This is the first measured live cross-architecture LLM
  disagreement at temp 0 in the programme; it sharpens
  W30-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE on the
  infrastructure-discharge axis."

What you must NOT say (W31 honest scope):

* "W31 implements a learned trust model."  It does not.  The
  online running-mean update is closed-form arithmetic
  (``new = (prev * n + obs) / (n + 1)``) shipped in W30 and now
  fired inside the W31 orchestrator on every cell.  Zero
  parameters; zero gradients; zero training step.  A truly-learned
  variant remains the named open conjecture
  **W31-C-LONG-WINDOW-CONVERGENCE** at the trajectory-window
  scaling axis (open).
* "W31 implements transformer-internal latent control."  It does
  not.  The sealed prior trajectory is a capsule-layer accumulator
  over W30's deterministic per-cell agreement signal; an honest
  **proxy** for the LatentMAS online-calibration direction, not a
  runtime hidden-state transplant.  W31 does not touch transformer
  KV caches, hidden states, attention weights, or embedding
  tables.
* "W31 proves temporal ordering at the model layer."  It does not.
  The prior trajectory is a sealed tuple of
  ``(cell_idx, partition_id, observed_agreement, prior_after)``
  bytes; the controller's bus enforces structural commitment to
  the declared trajectory, not to a particular execution sequence
  at the model layer.
* "W31 solves the live cross-host disagreement → strict correctness
  improvement axis."  Not yet.  The S1 result records
  2/8 = 0.250 cross-architecture disagreement at temp 0 (the
  FIRST live disagreement signal in the programme), but the full
  mechanism integration where W31 reroutes the disagreed cell to
  a registered high-trust partition AND the gold-correctness
  label correlates with one or the other model's answer is the
  named open **W31-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE**
  (gold-correlation axis).
* "W31 brings up Mac 2."  It does not.  192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (26th consecutive milestone).
* "W31 closes W30-C-NATIVE-LATENT."  It does not.  W31 is a
  capsule-layer mechanism extension; the architecture-dependent
  native-latent question carries forward as
  **W31-C-NATIVE-LATENT**.
* "W31 solves multi-agent context."  One named conjecture
  discharged (W30-C-PRIOR-LEARNING) + one sharpened
  (W30-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE on the
  infrastructure-discharge axis) is a strong step, but real
  multi-agent reality has more axes than any 5-seed synthetic
  bench + 8-prompt live probe can test.

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-78-NONSTATIONARY-PRIOR, R-78-ADAPTIVE-THRESHOLD vs
  R-78-FROZEN-THRESHOLD, and R-78-MANIFEST-TAMPER (three
  pre-committed regimes), the W31 online self-calibrated geometry-
  aware dense control mechanism simultaneously discharges
  W30-C-PRIOR-LEARNING (Δ correctness w31 vs w30 = +0.125 across
  5/5 seeds, trust precision 1.000) AND isolates the adaptive-
  threshold contribution (+0.125 ≥ +0.05 over frozen 0.5
  threshold) AND closes the cross-component swap avenue (manifest
  CID + cross-cell trajectory CID check, 65/65 = 1.000 rejection
  rate).  The R-78-XLLM-LIVE probe also records the FIRST measured
  live cross-architecture LLM disagreement at temperature 0 in the
  programme (gemma2:9b vs qwen2.5:14b, 2/8 = 0.250 disagreement
  rate, reproducible byte-for-byte).  We have not solved multi-
  agent context; we have empirically discharged one named open
  conjecture (W30-C-PRIOR-LEARNING) and sharpened another
  (W30-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE on the
  infrastructure-discharge axis) on a milestone where the
  synthesis (W30 calibration + W31 closed-loop online learning +
  adaptive threshold + manifest CID + first live cross-arch
  disagreement) is the load-bearing reason correctness AND audit
  precision AND infrastructure-completeness all improve
  simultaneously.  The next true wall — the regime where the
  audited capsule-layer proxy is insufficient and real
  transformer-internal subspace projection is required — remains
  the named open frontier **W30-C-NATIVE-LATENT** /
  **W31-C-NATIVE-LATENT**, plus the gold-correlation axis of
  **W31-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE**."

### W32 forbidden moves

W32 introduces another wave of vocabulary that *sounds* learned or
model-internal: "long-window convergence", "EWMA prior accumulator",
"Page CUSUM change-point detector", "gold-correlation routing",
"manifest-v2 CID".  Each of these is a **capsule-layer audited
proxy**.  None of them claim a learned model in the deep-learning
sense (zero parameters, zero gradients, zero training step),
transformer-internal manipulation, or a runtime ground-truth
observation; the gold-correlation map is a **registered closed-
vocabulary table**, NOT a runtime ground-truth oracle.

What you may say (W32 honest scope):

* "On R-79-LONG-WINDOW (sweep over long_window ∈ {16, 32, 64, 128}
  on the prefix-then-shift drift_recover regime), the W32 EWMA +
  Page CUSUM mechanism achieves byte-for-W31-equal correctness
  across 5/5 seeds × 4/4 windows = 20/20 cell-window pairs at
  trust precision 1.000; zero degradation as window grows.  This
  is the W31-C-LONG-WINDOW-CONVERGENCE empirical discharge on the
  **scaling-stability axis**."
* "On R-79-DRIFT-RECOVER (the multi-shift load-bearing regime),
  the strict-gain bar Δ ≥ +0.10 is honestly-null: Δ = 0.000 across
  5/5 seeds.  The bar is bounded above by the **W32-L-CYCLE-CAP
  limitation theorem** (max strict gain = ``min(c_p / 4, c_s) / N
  ≤ 0.0625`` on cycle-capped dispatcher regimes); the mechanism
  is empirically validated by ``n_change_points = 1`` firing
  exactly at the shift boundary (cell 61) across 5/5 seeds."
* "On R-79-MANIFEST-V2-TAMPER, the W32 manifest-v2 CID +
  cross-cell convergence_state_cid check together detect five
  named tampers per ratified cell; rejection rate = 1.000 across
  1525 named tampers (5/5 seeds × 61 ratified cell-positions × 5
  tampers).  The manifest-v2 CID closes cross-component swap
  avenues that the W31 manifest CID alone cannot detect (the W31
  manifest does NOT include convergence_state_cid)."
* "On R-79-XLLM-LIVE-GOLD, gemma2:9b on localhost vs qwen2.5:14b
  on 192.168.12.191 agree on 19/20 = 0.950 of gold-verifiable
  structured-decision prompts at temperature 0.  This is the FIRST
  measured live cross-architecture LLM gold-verifiable agreement
  at temp 0 in the programme; combined with W31's R-78-XLLM-LIVE
  result (0.750 agreement on operational-decision prompts), the
  prompt-class-dependent cross-architecture disagreement frontier
  at temp 0 is now characterised."

What you must NOT say (W32 honest scope):

* "W32 implements a learned trust model."  It does not.  EWMA +
  CUSUM are closed-form arithmetic with zero parameters.
* "W32 implements transformer-internal latent control."  It does
  not.  EWMA + CUSUM accumulators live at the capsule layer; an
  honest **proxy** for the LatentMAS long-window-convergent
  direction, not a runtime hidden-state transplant.
* "The W32 gold-correlation map observes ground truth at
  runtime."  It does not.  The map is a *registered closed-
  vocabulary table*; the controller registers it up-front; the
  W32 layer at runtime only reads from the map, never writes to
  it.  If the map is wrong, the W32-Λ-mis-correlated-gold
  falsifier fires (gate-bounded on synthetic; will fire on regimes
  with real cross-host disagreement).
* "W32 strictly improves correctness over W31 on all long-window
  regimes."  It does not.  On cycle-capped dispatcher regimes
  (which is the available R-79 bench infrastructure), the strict
  gain is bounded above by 0.0625 per the W32-L-CYCLE-CAP
  limitation theorem.  The strict-gain claim is honestly retained
  as **W32-C-LONG-WINDOW-STRICT-GAIN** on a regime that exceeds
  the cycle-cap (single-partition or low-cycle-window dispatcher).
* "W32 brings up Mac 2."  It does not.  192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (**27th consecutive milestone**, ping 100% packet
  loss).
* "W32 closes W31-C-NATIVE-LATENT."  It does not.  W32 is a
  capsule-layer mechanism extension; the architecture-dependent
  native-latent question carries forward as
  **W32-C-NATIVE-LATENT**.
* "W32 closes the live cross-host gold-correlation axis."  It does
  not.  The S1 result records 19/20 = 0.950 agreement on gold-
  verifiable prompts at temp 0; the unique disagreement (D5: TCP
  three-way handshake) has neither host correct.  The
  gold-correlation axis remains open as
  **W32-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-GOLD-MAGNITUDE**.
* "W32 solves multi-agent context."  Five rivets tightened in one
  milestone (scaling-stability discharge of W31-C-LONG-WINDOW-
  CONVERGENCE, Page CUSUM change-point detection, manifest-v2
  cross-component tamper detection, gold-correlation routing
  infrastructure, first live cross-architecture LLM gold-
  verifiable agreement at temp 0) is a strong step, but real
  multi-agent reality has more axes than any 5-seed × 4-window
  synthetic sweep + 20-prompt live probe can test.

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-79-LONG-WINDOW, R-79-MANIFEST-V2-TAMPER, R-79-DRIFT-RECOVER
  (with W32-L-CYCLE-CAP limitation theorem), and R-79-XLLM-LIVE-GOLD
  (four pre-committed regimes), the W32 long-window convergent
  online geometry-aware dense control mechanism simultaneously
  discharges W31-C-LONG-WINDOW-CONVERGENCE on the scaling-stability
  axis (W32 ≥ W31 byte-for-byte across 5/5 seeds × 4/4 windows AT
  trust precision 1.000) AND closes the cross-component swap
  avenue beyond the W31 manifest CID (manifest-v2 CID + cross-cell
  convergence_state_cid check, 1525/1525 = 1.000 rejection rate)
  AND surfaces the W32-L-CYCLE-CAP limitation theorem (Δ_max ≤
  0.0625 on cycle-capped dispatcher regimes, structurally bounded)
  AND records the FIRST measured live cross-architecture LLM
  gold-verifiable agreement at temperature 0 in the programme
  (gemma2:9b vs qwen2.5:14b on 19/20 = 0.950 of gold-verifiable
  prompts, the honest converse of W31's 6/8 = 0.750 agreement on
  operational prompts).  We have not solved multi-agent context;
  we have empirically discharged one named open conjecture
  (W31-C-LONG-WINDOW-CONVERGENCE on the scaling-stability axis),
  sharpened another (W31-C-CROSS-HOST-VARIANCE-LIVE-MAGNITUDE-LIVE
  on the prompt-class-dependent agreement frontier), and proved a
  named limitation theorem (W32-L-CYCLE-CAP) that makes explicit
  the structural bound on strict-gain claims under cycle-capped
  dispatcher regimes — a load-bearing honest-scope distinction.
  The next true wall — the regime where the audited capsule-layer
  proxy is insufficient and real transformer-internal subspace
  projection is required — remains the named open frontier
  **W32-C-NATIVE-LATENT**, plus the gold-correlation axis of
  **W32-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-GOLD-MAGNITUDE** (where the
  cross-architecture disagreement on gold-verifiable prompts at
  temp 0 systematically aligns with the gold-correctness label),
  the strict-gain axis of **W32-C-LONG-WINDOW-STRICT-GAIN** (which
  requires a regime that exceeds the W32-L-CYCLE-CAP limitation
  theorem), and the EWMA-tracked-trust integration axis of
  **W32-C-OLD-LINE-EWMA-TRUST**."

### W33 forbidden moves

W33 introduces another wave of vocabulary that *sounds* like a
learned trust model: "trust-EWMA-tracked", "per-oracle agreement
signal", "oracle-trust-state CID", "trust-trajectory CID", "anchor-
oracle reference", "manifest-v3 CID".  Each of these is a **capsule-
layer audited proxy** for the multi-oracle adjudication line that
W21 opened in 2025.  None of them claim a learned trust model in
the deep-learning sense (zero parameters, zero gradients, zero
training step), transformer-internal hidden-state manipulation, or
a runtime ground-truth oracle; the per-oracle agreement signal is a
**deterministic top-set comparison** against a registered closed-
vocabulary anchor.

What you may say (W33 honest scope):

* "On R-80-COMPROMISED-SHIFT (a three-phase oracle-compromise
  regime: K1 = 3N/8 calibration / K2 = 5N/8 single compromise /
  K3 = N double compromise), W33 EWMA-tracks each oracle's per-cell
  agreement against a registered anchor-oracle reference; oracles
  whose EWMA falls below the trust threshold are excluded from the
  effective tally; the resulting trust precision is **1.000 across
  5/5 seeds × 16 cells/seed vs W21 = 0.625 ⇒ Δ = +0.375**, with
  zero correctness regression and max overhead 1 token/cell.  This
  jointly discharges **W21-C-CALIBRATED-TRUST** AND **W32-C-OLD-
  LINE-EWMA-TRUST** in a single milestone."
* "On R-79-SINGLE-PARTITION (a prefix-then-shift regime over a
  single-partition signature space whose effective signature
  diversity exceeds the W32-L-CYCLE-CAP cycle-capped Δ_max ≤ 0.0625
  bound by construction), Δ(W32 - W31) = +0.100 across 5/5 seeds ×
  80 cells.  This is the **W32-C-LONG-WINDOW-STRICT-GAIN empirical
  discharge** on a regime that the cycle-cap does not bound."
* "On R-80-MANIFEST-V3-TAMPER, the W33 manifest-v3 CID + cross-
  component CID checks together detect five named tampers per
  ratified cell; rejection rate = 1.000 across 400 named tampers
  (5/5 seeds × 16 cells × 5 tampers).  The manifest-v3 CID closes
  cross-component swap avenues that the W21/W32 manifests alone
  cannot detect (the W33 manifest binds w21_oracle_cid +
  oracle_trust_state_cid + trust_trajectory_cid +
  anchor_oracle_set_cid + route_audit_cid_v3 + w32_long_window_cid
  together)."

What you must NOT say (W33 honest scope):

* "W33 implements a learned trust model."  It does not.  The
  per-oracle EWMA accumulator is closed-form arithmetic with zero
  parameters; the agreement signal is a deterministic top-set
  comparison.
* "W33 implements transformer-internal trust subspace projection."
  It does not.  The W33 trust state lives at the capsule layer; an
  honest **proxy** for the LatentMAS cross-agent-trust direction,
  not a runtime hidden-state transplant.  The architecture-
  dependent native-trust question carries forward as
  **W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT**.
* "W33 observes runtime ground truth."  It does not.  The anchor-
  oracle reference is a *registered subset of the same oracle
  registrations the controller already trusts*; the W33 layer
  derives the agreement signal from the controller's own probes,
  never from out-of-band ground truth.  If the anchor itself
  becomes compromised, the **W33-Λ-mis-trust-shift** falsifier
  documents the failure mode.
* "W33 closes the live cross-host trust-magnitude axis."  It does
  not.  The S1 live probe (mixtral:8x7b vs qwen3.5:35b) is honestly
  null on infrastructure (qwen3.5:35b not actually loaded on the
  remote host; mixtral past-token-budget at temp 0).  Two named
  infrastructure-fix items (W33-INFRA-1, W33-INFRA-2) are recorded;
  **W33-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-TRUST-MAGNITUDE** remains an open
  conjecture.
* "W33 brings up Mac 2."  It does not.  192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (**28th consecutive milestone**, ping 100% packet
  loss).
* "W33 strictly improves trust precision on every multi-oracle
  regime."  It does not.  On regimes where no oracle is
  compromised (R-80-NO-TRUST-SHIFT) or where the trust threshold
  is pinned at 1.0 (R-80-FROZEN-TRUST-THRESHOLD), the gate never
  fires and Δ = 0; the falsifiers W33-Λ-no-trust-shift and
  W33-Λ-frozen-threshold document this.
* "W33 solves multi-oracle adjudication."  Three rivets tightened
  in one milestone (W21-C-CALIBRATED-TRUST + W32-C-OLD-LINE-EWMA-
  TRUST joint discharge, W32-C-LONG-WINDOW-STRICT-GAIN discharge
  on a single-partition regime, manifest-v3 cross-component tamper
  detection at 1.000 reject rate) is a strong step, but real
  multi-oracle reality has more axes than any 5-seed × 16-cell
  synthetic sweep can test.

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-80-COMPROMISED-SHIFT, R-80-MANIFEST-V3-TAMPER, R-80-TRIVIAL-
  W33, and R-79-SINGLE-PARTITION (four pre-committed regimes), the
  W33 trust-EWMA-tracked multi-oracle adjudication mechanism
  simultaneously discharges **W21-C-CALIBRATED-TRUST** AND
  **W32-C-OLD-LINE-EWMA-TRUST** AND **W32-C-LONG-WINDOW-STRICT-
  GAIN** (a joint three-conjecture discharge in a single milestone)
  AND closes the cross-component swap avenue beyond the W21 / W32
  manifests (manifest-v3 CID + cross-component CID check, 400/400
  = 1.000 rejection rate).  We have not solved multi-oracle
  adjudication; we have empirically discharged three named open
  conjectures across two research lines (the OLD W21 multi-oracle
  line AND the NEW W32 long-window-convergent line).  The next
  true wall — the regime where the audited capsule-layer trust
  proxy is insufficient and real transformer-internal trust
  subspace projection is required — remains the named open
  frontier **W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT**, plus the live cross-host
  trust-magnitude axis of **W33-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-TRUST-MAGNITUDE**
  (currently infrastructure-bounded), the multi-host topology axis
  of **W33-C-MULTI-HOST**, and the latent cross-agent-trust axis
  of **W33-C-LATENT-CROSS-AGENT-TRUST**."

### W34 forbidden moves

W34 introduces another wave of vocabulary that *sounds* like
runtime LLM hidden-state inspection: "live oracle attestation",
"response-feature signature", "native-latent audited proxy",
"host-aware EWMA decay", "manifest-v4 CID", "preflight ``/api/tags``
discipline".  Each of these is a **capsule-layer audited proxy**
for the live-aware multi-anchor trust mechanism.  None of them
claims a learned feature-signature model in the deep-learning sense
(zero parameters, zero gradients, zero training step), transformer-
internal hidden-state manipulation, runtime KV transplant, or
out-of-band live ground-truth.  The response-feature signature is
a **closed-form deterministic SHA-256 prefix** over (first-token-
class, length-bucket, structural-hash); the multi-anchor consensus
is a **deterministic intersection** of registered anchor probes'
top_sets; the host-aware EWMA decay is a **closed-form
multiplicative scalar** in [0.5, 1.0].

What you may say (W34 honest scope):

* "On R-81-DOUBLE-ANCHOR-COMPROMISE (a three-phase compromise
  regime where the W33 single-anchor itself is compromised in the
  final phase), the W34 multi-anchor consensus reference correctly
  collapses to NO_CONSENSUS when the anchors disagree, and W34
  abstains where W33 commits to wrong; trust precision rises from
  0.625 to **1.000 across 5/5 seeds × 16 cells/seed ⇒ Δ = +0.375**,
  with zero correctness regression and max overhead 1 token/cell.
  This **closes the W33 single-anchor fragility** at the capsule
  layer."
* "On R-81-MANIFEST-V4-TAMPER, the W34 manifest-v4 CID + cross-
  component CID checks together detect five named tampers per
  ratified cell; rejection rate = **1.000 across 400 named tampers**
  (5/5 seeds × 16 cells × 5 tampers).  The manifest-v4 CID closes
  cross-component swap avenues that the W33 manifest-v3 alone
  cannot detect."
* "On R-81-RESPONSE-FEATURE-SIGNATURE, the closed-form 64-bit
  signature is byte-stable across 10 fixtures × 3 runs = 30/30
  byte-equal calls."
* "The W34 milestone closes the two named W33 infrastructure
  follow-ups via load-bearing mechanism in the live xLLM pilot:
  preflight ``/api/tags`` (W33-INFRA-1) — *honest empirical
  correction* recorded that the W33 'qwen3.5:35b not loaded'
  diagnosis was wrong; the model IS loaded — and chat-template +
  ``num_predict=4`` + stop tokens (W33-INFRA-2)."

What you must NOT say (W34 honest scope):

* "W34 implements a learned feature-signature model."  It does
  not.  ``compute_response_feature_signature`` is a closed-form
  SHA-256 hex prefix; zero parameters, zero gradients, zero
  training step.
* "W34 implements transformer-internal hidden-state projection."
  It does not.  The response-feature signature lives at the
  capsule layer; an honest **proxy** for native-latent (the
  architecture-dependent direction), not a runtime hidden-state
  transplant.  The W34 audited proxy detects feature-class
  shifts (one-word ↔ chain-of-thought, alpha ↔ digit, short ↔
  long) but cannot probe the model's hidden subspaces.
  ``W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT`` carries forward.
* "W34 solves the live cross-host trust-magnitude axis."  It does
  not.  The S1 live probe (5 host+model pairs × 13 prompts at
  temp 0) records best-effort evidence with the corrected infra
  discipline; the agreement-magnitude question is independent of
  the infra question and is honestly null on any prompt class
  where the available LLMs at temp 0 happen to agree.
  ``W33-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-TRUST-MAGNITUDE`` and
  ``W34-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-MULTI-ANCHOR`` carry forward.
* "W34 brings up Mac 2."  It does not.  192.168.12.248 remains
  ARP-incomplete (**29th consecutive milestone**, ping 100%
  packet loss; port 11434 unreachable).
* "W34 strictly improves trust precision on every regime."  It
  does not.  On regimes where no anchor is compromised
  (R-81-NO-ANCHOR-DISAGREEMENT) or where the host-decay factor
  is pinned at 1.0 (R-81-FROZEN-HOST-DECAY), the multi-anchor
  consensus matches single-anchor and the host-aware decay never
  fires; Δ = 0.  The falsifiers W34-Λ-no-anchor-disagreement and
  W34-Λ-frozen-host-decay document this.
* "W34 defeats double-anchor compromise."  It does not — only
  *single*-anchor compromise.  The new
  **W34-L-MULTI-ANCHOR-CAP** limitation theorem (proved by
  inspection) names the structural ceiling: when all K anchors
  are simultaneously compromised at the capsule layer, no
  multi-anchor mechanism (including W34) can recover.  Native-
  latent (architecture-dependent) is required to break this.
* "W34 solves multi-anchor adjudication."  Two rivets closed in
  one milestone (W33 single-anchor fragility via multi-anchor
  consensus + manifest-v4 cross-component tamper detection at
  1.000 reject rate; W33-INFRA-1 + W33-INFRA-2 jointly closed)
  is a strong step, but real multi-anchor reality has more axes
  than any 5-seed × 16-cell synthetic sweep can test.

The honest summary one may emit:

* "On R-81-DOUBLE-ANCHOR-COMPROMISE, R-81-MANIFEST-V4-TAMPER,
  R-81-TRIVIAL-W34, R-81-RESPONSE-FEATURE-SIGNATURE,
  R-81-NO-ANCHOR-DISAGREEMENT, R-81-FROZEN-HOST-DECAY (six pre-
  committed regimes), the W34 live-aware multi-anchor adjudication
  mechanism closes the W33 single-anchor fragility AND closes the
  cross-component swap avenue beyond the W33 manifest-v3 (manifest-
  v4 CID, 400/400 = 1.000 rejection rate) AND adds an audited
  proxy step toward native-latent (response-feature signature,
  byte-stable) AND closes two named infrastructure follow-ups
  (W33-INFRA-1 + W33-INFRA-2).  We have not solved multi-anchor
  adjudication; we have empirically closed a structural fragility
  in the W33 trust mechanism + closed two named infra follow-ups
  + tightened the trust boundary by 14 more enumerated failure
  modes (cumulative 84 across W22 + W29 + W30 + W31 + W32 + W33
  + W34) + proved a small but sharp limitation theorem
  (W34-L-MULTI-ANCHOR-CAP).  The next true wall — the regime
  where the audited capsule-layer multi-anchor proxy is
  insufficient and real transformer-internal hidden-state-level
  cross-agent trust evidence is required — remains the named open
  frontier **W33-C-NATIVE-LATENT**, plus the live cross-host
  trust-magnitude axis of **W33-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-TRUST-MAGNITUDE**
  AND **W34-C-CROSS-HOST-LIVE-MULTI-ANCHOR**, the multi-host
  topology axis of **W33-C-MULTI-HOST** AND **W34-C-MULTI-HOST**,
  and the latent cross-agent-trust axis of
  **W33-C-LATENT-CROSS-AGENT-TRUST**."


### "W46 implements transformer-internal memory" or "W46 closes the deep-coupling conjecture"

> *"W46 implements transformer-internal time attention over the
> model's KV cache."*

Forbidden.  W46 implements a **capsule-layer, multi-layer,
memory-conditioned controller** that operates over W43 channel
encodings.  It does NOT read hidden states, transplant KV cache,
inspect attention weights, or modify the model's attention
computation.  The W43 conjectures
(W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT,
W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING,
W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY) and
W45-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING carry forward unchanged.

Permitted phrasing: *"W46 is a multi-layer learned manifold
memory controller at the capsule layer.  It fits a stack of
closed-form ridge layers on layer-wise residuals, applies a
rank-r role adapter, encodes channel features into a learned
dictionary basis, performs causally-masked cosine-similarity
time-attention over a bounded memory bank of past gate logits,
emits a packed multi-line MANIFOLD_CTRL model-facing control
block, and binds a deterministic shared-prefix capsule.  Every
component is content-addressed; the W46 envelope verifier
enumerates 21 disjoint failure modes; cumulative trust boundary
across W22..W46 = 261 enumerated failure modes."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W46 is true deep learning"* (it is
stage-wise closed-form ridge), *"W46 manipulates the model's
attention"* (it does not), *"W46 pools KV cache across turns"*
(it binds byte-identical prefix bytes, not KV state), *"W46
implements rank-r LoRA on a transformer"* (it implements a
rank-r perturbation of the capsule-layer policy parameters),
*"W46 closes deep-transformer-coupling"* (the conjecture
W45-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING carries forward).

The honest reading is narrower: on R-93-LONG-BRANCHING-MEMORY,
W46 lifts deep-turns precision from 0.000 (W44 / W45) to 1.000
(min == max across 5/5 seeds) because the multi-layer +
causally-masked time-attention readout pools positive gate
evidence from past turns that the single-cell W45 controller
cannot see.  On R-93-COMPRESSED-CONTROL-PACKING the packed
MANIFOLD_CTRL block adds approximately 9-10 structured bits
per visible ctrl-token at L=2 / K=4 / 5 roles, with a
structurally bounded ≤ 40-extra-tokens-per-turn overhead vs the
W45 single-line hint.  The shared-prefix capsule emits
byte-identical prefix bytes across consecutive turns (1 reuse
per 4-turn run with prefix_turns=2).  We have not solved
deep-transformer-coupling; we have empirically demonstrated
that a closed-form multi-layer + memory + dictionary + packed-
control + shared-prefix capsule-layer mechanism lifts six of
the eight measurable surfaces vs the W45 single-layer
controller.  The cap remains: under all-six-channel + forged-
bank compromise, W46 cannot recover (downstream protect rate =
0.000 across 5/5 seeds — the W46-L-MEMORY-COMPROMISE-CAP
reproduces honestly).

The full hidden-state-aware deep-controller direction
(W45-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING,
W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT,
W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING,
W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY, plus the deliberately
deferred W46-C-AUTOGRAD-DEEP-STACK) remains substrate-
blocked / deliberately-deferred and out of capsule-layer scope.

Last touched: post-W45 research milestone (W46 family) 2026-05-10.


### "W51 closes cross-tokenizer behavioural transfer" or "W51 trains a true transformer"

> *"W51 closes cross-tokenizer behavioural transfer via the
> triple-backend translator."*

Forbidden.  W51's `TripleBackendTranslator` operates over
**capsule-layer carrier values** between three synthetic
backend tags `(A, B, C)`.  It does NOT touch real tokenizers,
real model attention, or real model embeddings.  The
transitivity loss penalises disagreement between `A→C`
(direct) and `A→B→C` (composed) over capsule-layer carriers
only.  The `W50-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-LATENT-TRANSFER` conjecture
carries forward sharpened as
`W51-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-TRIPLE-TRANSITIVITY` — capsule-layer
triple-backend transitivity is now trained and auditable,
but tokenizer-level transitivity remains substrate-blocked.

> *"W51's L=6 deep stack V2 is a deeper transformer with
> branch-specialised attention heads."*

Forbidden.  W51's `DeepProxyStackV2` is a **capsule-layer
proxy transformer stack** at `L=6`.  Its "branch-specialised
heads" are per-layer learned multiplicative gates over
**block outputs**, not real attention heads.  The W47/W48/W49/
W50 substrate-blocked conjectures
(`W47-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
`W48-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
`W49-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`,
`W50-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING`) carry forward unchanged.

Critically, **W51 does NOT claim depth monotonicity**: under
the pure-Python autograd training cost cap, `L=6` does NOT
strictly improve over `L=4` on the R-100
`family_deep_stack_v2_depth_strict_gain` regime (delta +0.014
on 3 seeds, well within the structural floor + non-regression
H4 bar of ≥ 0.65 and ≥ -0.05).  The actual M3 behavioural win
comes from **branch/cycle-specialised heads** (H5: +0.056) —
attribution to M3 as a whole is acceptable; attribution to
depth alone is not.  The `W51-L-DEEP-STACK-OVERDEPTH-CAP`
falsifier reproduces honestly on shallow regimes (H18).

> *"W51's persistent shared latent state V3 is real
> long-context memory in the LLM."*

Forbidden.  W51's `PersistentStateCell` is a
**GRU-style trainable capsule-layer state vector** that
updates per turn via the W47 autograd engine.  It does NOT
modify the LLM's hidden states, KV cache, or attention.  The
"persistent latent state chain" is a content-addressed audit
trail of capsule-layer state values across turns — not real
model memory.

> *"W51 achieves ≥ 12 bits per real visible LLM token."*

Forbidden.  W51's `HierarchicalCompressionCodebook` packs
structured bits into a `LATENT_CTRL_V3_H` **capsule-layer
control block**.  The "visible token" count is a capsule-layer
surrogate for the packed block; real LLM tokens may or may
not match this 1-to-1 (the
`W51-L-CTRL-AWARE-MODEL-INDIFFERENCE-CAP` carries forward
from W48/W49/W50).  The H15 bar of ≥ 12 bits/visible-token is
**a structural compression ratio over the W51 carrier**, not
a behavioural claim about real LLM context absorption.

Permitted phrasing: *"W51 is six orthogonal trainable
capsule-layer mechanisms layered on top of W50: a GRU-style
persistent shared latent state V3 with cross-role mixer; a
triple-backend translator with a trainable transitivity loss
over capsule carriers; an L=6 deep proxy stack V2 with
branch/cycle-specialised heads and per-layer learned
temperatures; a hierarchical adaptive compression V3 with
K1=32 coarse + K2=16 fine codebooks achieving ≥ 12 bits per
visible capsule-layer ctrl token at full emit; a two-headed
long-horizon reconstruction V3 (causal + branch) at max_k=8;
a branch/cycle-specialised memory head with per-page storage
+ learned consensus + merger. Every component is content-
addressed; the W51 envelope verifier enumerates 24 disjoint
failure modes; cumulative trust boundary across W22..W51 =
**367 enumerated failure modes**.  R-100 (11 cell families)
+ R-101 (8 cell families) at 3 seeds each — 18/18 H bars
pass.  W51 is the strongest *executable proxy* for
persistent, transitive, deeply-stacked, hierarchically-
compressed, long-horizon-reconstructed, branch/cycle-aware
shared-state transfer at the capsule layer — it is NOT a
deeper transformer."*

Forbidden phrasing: *"W51 is true cross-tokenizer transfer"*
(it is not — the W51-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-TRIPLE-TRANSITIVITY
conjecture carries forward), *"W51 implements transformer-
internal long-context memory"* (it does not), *"W51 is GPU-
accelerated"* (it is pure-Python autograd), *"W51 packs ≥ 12
bits per real LLM token"* (the visible-token count is
capsule-layer), *"W51's L=6 strictly beats L=4"* (it ties on
the R-100 regime; the V2 win comes from branch/cycle
specialisation), *"W51 closes
W50-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-LATENT-TRANSFER"* (it sharpens it as
W51-C-CROSS-TOKENIZER-TRIPLE-TRANSITIVITY but does not close).

The full hidden-state-aware deep-controller direction
(W50-C-DEEP-TRANSFORMER-COUPLING,
W43-C-MIXED-CURVATURE-LATENT,
W43-C-COLLECTIVE-KV-POOLING,
W43-C-FULL-GRASSMANNIAN-HOMOTOPY,
W48-C-REAL-KV-COUPLED-PROXY,
W48-C-MULTI-HOST-SHARED-STATE) remains substrate-blocked /
deliberately-deferred and out of capsule-layer scope.

Last touched: post-W50 research milestone (W51 family) 2026-05-11.
